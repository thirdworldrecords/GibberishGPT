    Ugh. Reduced to marking my camp with bear sweat. Those bears did not want to give up that sweat, but it keeps the rodents from nibbling my lumps while I sleep. Ouch! I feel something crunchy!

O-okay, I really do need to tell you how to care for Sweet P. Uh, there's a proper procedure for Sweet P's special tuck-in time. You have to be real sweet to him. Pat him gently on the head, kiss his cheeks What? And give him treats. Sing to him real, real soft and sweet and touch your forehead to his and think the words, "you are more precious than anything in this world, and I will always, always love you." Then he'll fall asleep and have sweet dreams. Oh, my glob, I'll do all that! Okay, bye! Have a wonderful time! Time to get down to the chill-out!  What a princess like me deserves. Aah!

Must be time for toast! I'm waiting Waiting Waiting All done!  It's not black and crunchy like when I throw bread into my campfire.  This music's way better than owls' hoots.  I deserve this.  No!

LSPita bread, what's up? Just chillin' in my awesome bubble bath! Did you break into someone's house again?  I have a new life now and a career. I didn't know you had any skills. Success isn't about skills. It's about being cool. These people just randomly approached me, like, "hey, we will totally pay you to hang out in our sick mansion and feed our baby or whatever." Well, good for you, dude. I mean, I feel like a totally new person now that I'm finally getting what I deserve.  Oh, my glob, what is that?!  Aah! LSP? Mm. -  -  Take this, you dandruff! LSP. Huh? You don't belong here in the world of decent people. You belong in the woods with Garbage animals! Noooooooo!  Will you be sweet to me? Will you kiss my cheeks? Will you give me treats?  Blech!

They didn't understand my Lemonstylz. I like this way better. Hmm I wonder if maybe you don't understand their Candy stylz. Come on! Let me show you something. You see, Earl, candy people are mad special. They need constant stroking and snuggling.   Here, you try. Ha-ha, ha! Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha!  Goo-goo, uh, g-goo! Put you in my oven! Nyah! It's gross!

     FlNN: Safety Patrol! JAKE: Safety Patrol! Safety patrol! Safety -- oh, were we not wearing the uniforms? Come on. Let's keep looking for hazards. Look out! What is it, Dude? Shushers, man. Look there. Just looks like an ordinary little town, man. Yeah. Suspiciously ordinary. Oh, little house people. Maybe it is just regular ordinary, not sinister ordinary. Oh, no, wait. Grass Ogre.  Hey, chicken! You're traveling ''Eggspress.''  lt's an obnoxious grass Ogre. You get my joke, right?  Careful, you oaf! Those chickens are rentals! Oh! We're having so much fun, huh?  Drop that chicken. Huh? You're under arrest. Good. Now get in your tiny cell. Uh, oh. Oh, uh, uh  Hey, Ogre! Stop hazing these cute little houses! Yeah, jerk ball! My name is Donny, idiot. Sorry, l was just trying to get your attention. What kind of houses are you supposed to be -- uh, stupid, uha dumb house?  Hey, what's with your jowl? Ow!  l'm gonna mess with these housies some more. Never! Ugh! So, you want to wrestle, huh? 'Cause l know, like, this Ninja move to get out of this lock instantly.  Okay, now, first, l --  Hey, you're doing it wrong! Stop cheating! Whoa. You're doing it wrong. What do you mean? First, you roll your right shoulder forward. Ugh, like this? Yeah, but then l counter it by doing this. Hey.  Um, you need to take a break? No.  But if you need to, we can stop. You baby. Whoa, l zoned out there for a bit. Did you win? Nah, just taking five. Donny's pretty good. Yeah, well, you're okay, too. Thanks, man. DONNY: For a complete idiot! Aww. -  Donald, quit all this jerky nonsense! Ugh! Unless you went to get gored by a forest Prince! l was just kidding around. But then you took it too far. You guys are the real jerks.  Pshh! Donny is one mixed-up dude. Nah, he's just rough-and-tumble like me. But deep down, he's probably really sensitive like me. You're a mixed-up dude, too. - Hey, Donny! - What? l was thinking that since you're a pretty good wrestler, maybe you'd want to hang out with a couple of rascals like me and Jake. What? Uh, l don't know. Messing with these housies is pretty fun. You got something better? You sure this is a good idea? lf you come to the tree fort, we got video games and apple juice. Really?! l mean Fine. lf it keeps you from crying. Donny's problem is that he's treated as an outsider, like me. You are not an outsider. You wear cute little blue shorts. lam complicated. DONNY: Uh, this fort isn't so great. Not as cool as the fort l'm gonna build. l call this chair! Hey, Donny. You should play ''Bug Battle.'' And, hey, can you put on some pants? You put on some pants! l have pants spun from spider webs by Pixies. Okay, there's you, and here come the bugs. Uh, yeah.  Huh? Oh, yeah. Those guys will get you. Ugh! This game cheats! Ohh.  Not cool, dude. Have more apple juice. lt always makes me feel better when l -- ugh! Donny, quit being a jerk! What? What did l do? Ugh! Finn, l don't think this is gonna work. l am incapable of all emotion, but you are making me chaffed. Everybody's getting mad at me for nothing! You have to think about how your actions make other people feel. Oh. Hmm. l don't understand at all. Ooh, teach him that little empathy song l taught you. Okay, yeah.  Empathy, empathy Put yourself in the place of me  Your turn. - Uh  Empathy, empathy Put yourself  Oh! So it's like when l squeeze eggs out of chickens, l should let them squeeze eggs out of me, too. Umkind of right. Ugh! Ugh! Someone needs our help! Jake, you stay here and try to fix him while l deal with an unknown, possibly deadly emergency. Dude, trade me jobs.  DONNY: Jake, somebody broke your, um, entire living room!  Quick -- act abandoned! Hands off the housing market!  Whoa! Hey! Ow! Backpack! Werewolves -- much worse than ogres. Whoa! Stop in the name of the law. ls there somewhere l can trap that thing? Well, we had a zoo, but he moved back East. Of course, there's always the old well. l'm not old. Perfect!  Ha! Ha!  Slam bam in a can.  Huh? Another werewolf? What's up with this town?   Mr. Bank, are you all right? Oh, it's fine. lt's fine. All my assets are insured. Pardon, l have to go spackle my cracks. Oh. Why is this town just getting worse and worse?  Yes. Why, indeed? Hey, what are you werewolves up to? We're not werewolves!  We're Why-wolves. Uh, Why-wolves? Creatures possessed by the spirit of inquiry.  And bloodlust! What?  Please. Save your questions until the end of the lecture. Our ecosystem -- at the bottom level are the house people. Given the opportunity, we Why-wolves would easily wipe them out.  However Donny's presence is a natural deterrent. His jerkiness is so powerful that it produces a pungent gas, obnoxygen. To Why-wolves, it is a deadly poison.  But since you've removed the jerk Donny  We will devour the houses, and our population will rapidly swell until we are, in turn, devoured by the cosmic owl. Hoo! Such is the course of nature. But it'll be a pretty sweet ride up until that point.  Tonight we feast on the blood of the innocent!  Oh, no! l have to get Donny back!  Donny, you have to go right now and stop the Why-wolves from -- Aah, Master Finn has returned. What's it going? Thanks to you, l shall never be jerky again. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, this is all wrong! We need Jerk Donny to make the obnoxygen and -- and -- Steady on, Finn. Perhaps you're dehydrated. lt's as Jake taught me.  Eight ounces, eight glasses, eight days a week  l'll fetch you some tap water. Are you wearing jeans now? Surely.  Got to get pants Go get your pants Button fly!  l wrote that one myself. PerdÃ³name. But, but, but But, but, but, yeah, Donny! You're looking good in those jeans. What did you do?! Miraculous, isn't it? l just kept teaching him my musical rules, and now he's perfect. No! We messed up, Jake! The house people are doomed if Donny doesn't go back to being town jerk!  l've no intention of being a jerk again. Hmm. But the housies will be wiped out if you don't. lt sounds tragic, but l'm turning over a new leaf. Donny, you got to go! Finn, no means no. l'm sure you'll respect my wishes. No! Stop! No!  Now, go be a jerk to those Why-wolves. No.  l'll use my musical messages to stop them. Let's see. l've got one on the ethics of laundry, ''Crosswalkery.'' Ooh, here's a good one.  Man, the town is getting creamed! By not being a jerk, you're being a real jerk, Donny.  Comb your hair right lt's a good time Sticky, sticky pomade Short back and sides Why isn't anyone paying attention to my words? He sure is sensitive about his songs.  lt's 'cause they think your songs are dumb! Wha? What are you saying? lf we don't encourage his talent, he might revert back to jerk Don-- oh, oh! Hey, Donny, everyone says your songs are super balls. They all think you're a real jerk! But -- but l've changed! Why would they say that?  Empathy, empathy Put your mind inside -- You are so pathetic so comical. Think l'm a jerk, do they? l'm feelingobnoxious!  You wolves are cool! Just kidding!  Obnoxygen cloud! Egress! ALL: The town is saved! Yay! Get off of me, nerds! You did it, Donny. You're a full-blown jerk again. What?! You're the jerk! Housies, ready to hear my new song? lt's about how Finn will betray you just to save lives. l'm sorry, Donny. l'll never forgive you, Finn!  Come on. We can go stare wistfully at the lake. l'd -- l'd like that very much.  Hey! l love being a jerk! Thanks, Finn. Finn? Finn, you loser.  l'll never forget you.

Then I can get busy with undoing your cheesy influence, plus, more! With my help, Jake'll become the criminal juggernaut he was always meant to be. We won't just be robbing banks anymore. We'll be robbing the actual banks. The whole banks! You get it? We're gonna steal actual whole buildings. Yeah, I get it. So don't tell me "we're not so different," okay?! We're opposites, you and me. Oil and goody-goody snow-white baby-vanilla-bean mitten water! Go, Tiffany! Man, that nut's gonna try and stick me while I'm not even looking. Don't even stress it, Finn. You're Finn Mertens, man. You got this. Man, I hope so. Finn! Get in here, quick! The junction. There's something moving in the walls. It was like Crk brk crnch crk brk brmble! Wallworms! Holy cow! Dang it, Tiffany, not yet! We got to work together to beat the worms! Here they come! Tiffany! Unh! Oh, snap! Look out! They're coming in from the side! - You good? - My tooth hurts. Dang!

We're two peas in a pod! We're not oil and water. We're oil and vinegar. It's good, man. It's yummy! - Mm - It's good for you! You're right, Finn. I can't bring myself to do it. But I can't bring myself to save you, either. Why are you still smiling? Sorry. I didn't hear what you said. - I was just gonna let it slide. - Look, you're you're on your own. I'm sorry. Catch you on the flip, I guess. Tiffany? Tiffa n-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! Unh! Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Whoa! Easy, son. Don't try to speak. - Your mouth is full of ants. - Huh? It's okay. We just finished up. Ah. What happened down there? Where's Tiffany? Well, the good news is, the worm queen was defeated choked to death on some foreign object presumably Cadet Tiffany, who is missing in action, - which is the bad news. - Tiffany But we didn't have to fix his teeth, which is nice news But we did have to fix your teeth, which is okay news. Huh huh. 'Eyyy! So, on behalf of the ant nation, I'd like to thank you for your service, which is now concluded. As soon as you're ready, we'll get you stuffed back up that well with all the snakes and butter. Holy cow. Hooray! - Welcome home, Finn. - Yeah. Welcome home, buddy. Thanks, you guys!

So, wait, the whole kingdom is in on it'? Yes, and they'll only come out if they think we'll be surprised, so we got to act like we're totally unaware, okay'? Okay, man. And how do we do that? Just do what I'm doing. Oh, look at me. Living free without a suspicion in the world. Never in my wildest dreams would I guess someone was planning a surprise birthday party for me.  Pretty tricky, right? Come on, let's go back to the hut. The what? Come on! Come on!

So, what should I do now? Collect branches for the hobo fire, dude. Okay-  Ouchies. A hobo fire, fire, fire. Boy, it sure is quiet around here! Uh-huh! I'd probably pee all over myself if somebody jumped out and surprised me!  Oh! Oh, I stink! How long was I out for? A day or two? Huh. What a convenient place to bathe. Sure seems like a good time to come out if y'all are just hiding and you don't, you know, want to see me pop my top!  Oh, yeah. That's fresh. I hope nobody's gonna jump out of the bushes and peeps my bod! Heh heh heh heh! Blblblblblblblbl! Hmm. Just got to char out the rotten parts -- good as new, man. Stay vigilant. Eat your protein. Jake? Hmm? I am starting to question your theory about the surprise party. Shh! Don't talk so loud. They might hear you. But what if they're in trouble? What if something happened to them? We should try looking around. No! You'll ruin my surprise party! Ow! Oh! Arsh! Dude, are you okay? Just promise me, Finn -- promise not to look around.  Okay, I promise.  My birthday, it's gonna be rad.  Hey, it's you! Thanks for breaking my legs, you dumb-butt.  That sounds like Candy people. FINN: Jake! Jake! Mm. What? I heard a sound coming from the sewer.

CANDY PERSON: I'm gonna get clean!    


I'm home! Who's gonna have dinner with me tonight? Sorry, fellas. I got to go make some dreams come true. Where are we headed, dream token? Aha! Aw, Finn again. Say "cheese!" Cheese! "!eybdoog" yaS Hello! Huh? Wait, wait! Who's that? She's so beautiful! Butt feathers! Huh? Whoa, the cosmic owl?! Does that mean this dream is important?! Is this a prophetic dream?! And is this stuff all symbolic or literal? Huh? Oh, yeah, sort of. Wait. What does it all mean, boy? Dang, she's gone! What? W-w-what are you asking me? Uh, I can't tell you that. I don't know, shelby. I think it's too dark in there. Aah! Pull him up, pull him up! Think I just had a prophetic dream. Cosmic owl was in it. He was acting all choco-loco. Finn, you got to go back to sleep. Huh? Cosmic owl dreams are important always! You got to find him again! Yeah, but last time I chased a cosmic owl dream, I got dumped. Shh! Get back in there! It's too important. You don't got time to waste on my class ring or bets with shelby or stomach fishing. Oop! What? Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh! All right, let's do it. Hey, cosmic owl! You still here? Oh! Butt feathers Love is weird, man. It really does come when you least expect it. Dude, you've been working on that since you got here. Take a break. You haven't even asked me about my banjo lessons. They're going great! Dude? Sorry, I just can't stop thinking about her. You really are in love, huh? All right, tell me more about her. Where'd you meet? In a dream. What?! Whose?! Finn the human. What?! Who's that?! No, wait, I know that guy. Look, I don't think you were put in charge of prophetic dreams so you could meet ladies. Who cares? I'm in love! What am I even worried about? How will you ever even find her again? Do you have any idea how many people are dreaming every night? Yes, I do. Dude, it could take you a million years. Then it would be worth it For love! Forgot my sketchbook. It's gonna be a long night. Uh Hmm? Excuse me? Are these weenies? Shrimp puffs, monsieur. Oh. Uh, hi. Oh. Is that a weenie? It's a shrimp puff. Oh, I love shrimps puffs! Here. This is a dream come true. Do I know you? I'm crashing. Oh. I saw you in a dream, and I had to see you again, even though just by me being here, events in this dream will come true. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Agh! Oh, geez, that poor guy. Whose dream? Hmm? Whose dream did you see me in? Oh, uh, Finn the human. Hmm. I shouldn't be here. No, you intrigue me. So powerful. W-what's happening? You're waking up. Oh, no! Can't you go back to sleep? No, once I'm up, I'm up! But I want to see you again! I'd like that. Okay, I'll bookmark your dream coordinates and come to you tomorrow night. What do I do with the toothpick? I'll take it! And so then she's like, "I really like you," and I was like, "I really like you, too," and she was like, "I don't want to hold hands until I'm in love," and I was like, "that sounds great. I'm all about going slow," and she said, "what? You don't want to hold my hand?" Huh?! Okay, what is going on with that toothpick? Huh? I can get you a new toothpick. No, I don't want a new one. I got to go! No, wait, there's one Hi! Hi. Hmm, are there any appetizers? No, I think it's just ice in this dream. Oh, I wish I could dream another place. I have an idea. My apartment. Oh. It's a bit of a mess. I'm not used to having company. No, it's got Personality. I know, right? Hey, do you like board games? Tell me about this. Oh, I use that for work. It's interesting. Yeah, I guess it is. Y-you want to spy on people's dreams? Can we? Sure. What's it like to have all this at your fingertips? I guess I don't even think about it. But you're not powerful enough to see into everyone's dreams, are you? I'm totally that powerful. Even royalty? Like Ice King or something? His dreams are so sad. Like princess Bubblegum. Surely, she has some sort of dream security system in place. No, we can go right now. Is that what this is about? Yes, let's go right now. T-this feels weird. It seems like you really want to go. It's okay to feel manipulated, right? Oh, thank you! Thank you! A-after all I've done for you?! Agh! What? Something's wrong. Does this dream seem weird to you? No! I worked so hard! Aaaaah! Hey! Hey, you! Huh? Do you have any idea what you've done? You interfered with a dream! Oh, man, a dream I was in! Why did you do  it?! I I can't really explain it. It just felt like the right thing to do. You you ruined everything! We would've been so perfect together! Oh, who I am kidding?! It's over It doesn't have to be over. We can run away Together. You're dreaming, kid, and it's time to wake up. No, i-i Wenk! Gunther? Oh, did baby have a bad dream? Let me get you a bottle. Aah! Wenk! Huh, what's eating him?


    BMO: "Sumo scootz!" Vroom! Vroom! Reee!  Winner! Whoo! In your face! You okay, buddy? Still bummed out about Flame Princess? Hmm. I know what'll fix you up. Girls' night out, boy style. First, we'll go to the salon, get your hair did and your nails all Wait, no. First, we'll go to the shops, get you a brand-new hat. Then we'll A burglermur!  BOTH: The Ice King?! Grr! Ugh. Geez, you couldn't wait two seconds? Ugh. Why are you stinking up our house? Didn't you get my text? It said I'm staying with you guys oh. Didn't go through. Well, anyways, I knew you wouldn't mind, since it's sort of your fault I'm homeless, right? Right. 'Cause you tricked your crazy ex into melting my Ice Kingdom Mm-hmm. with your lies and secrets. Remember when that happened? Dude, you can't stay here if you're gonna stank it up with your bad vibes, man.  Yeah, I'm just crashing here while the penguins rebuild. I've given Gunter temporary reign. Should be fine. Flame Princess isn't crazy. You're blind, Finn. You're blind! Wait, she isn't here, is she? No. Whew! She said she wanted time to herself. Yeesh! Yeah. Breakups are tough. Heh. Yeah, like remember how you and I were married? Ugh! It's so confusing! Hmm? I thought Finn was a stand-up guy, you know? But he basically betrayed me. Why do people even have secrets? It's like that in the Fire Kingdom, too. Everyone is all deceitful and Shakespeare. But out here, it doesn't seem any different. Why do I have to feel like this?  And what is that noise?! Gah! - Unh. - Eee!  Yeah, yeah. Just act like I'm not here.  Are you spying on me?! What? No, of course not.  I was observing you for research.  You're a threat, Flame Princess. Your emotions are directly linked to your combustion levels. But if I can create a scientific model that describes your complete elemental matrix, I can isolate and suppress your more volatile traits. So, if you do your research, you'll know how to cut off my emotions so I won't feel like this? Um, yeah. Basically. Then I'll help you. You will? Yes. I'll do whatever it takes. Once I press this button, you'll be subjected to a battery of tests to gauge your reflexes, stamina, and your reaction to various emotional stimuli. This is going to help me understand myself? There's a 40% chance we'll be able to identify and isolate your chemical components and, yes, understand you in a very scientific way. Oh, that's good I guess. Initiate tests. Yah! Hello? Princess, we need you and your ball blam burglerbur right away! Gunter has created a race of strangling snow snakes or "Snow-a-constrictors!" Oh! Oh! Oh! Yahhhh!   Okay, Cinnamon Bun, all you have to do is write down the numbers that appear on this monitor. Can you do that one thing? Yes. Oh, one other thing. Do not open that door. So that's two things. Write down the numbers. Do not open that door. Got it? Yes, Princess.  Hello. Hello. You look sad. Yeah. But mostly I'm confused.  Me too. Really? Yeah. Bubblegum is bad. She is? I don't know. Want to pet my dog?! He lives at my house. What about the tests? I'm not good at tests.  La-de-da-de-da His name is Jake, but he's not the real Jake.  Oh. My body is soft. We're friends. Yeah. I really get you. But sometimes friends are hard to understand. Sometimes you think you know them, but you find out they're just playing mind games. Is the Princess your friend? I don't know. Yeah, because why did she lock you up in jail when you were a little baby? That was a weird friend thing.  MAN: The word! The word! FLAME KING: What's the word? The word is your newborn baby will have greater powers than you'll ever dream of! Uh have my baby sent into the wilderness of the outside world to perish. Okay! Ah! Oh. Hup. Ah! Aw.  Ho ho!  Wa-a-a-a-a-a-ah! Castle! What's this?  A Princess? Must have wandered off. Flame King! What do you want, Princess of the Gum World? I found your lost daughter. I-I don't remember losing anything.  Okay, you got me. I had her sent to wander in the woods. I was in fear of being usurped. Come on. That's your problem. But you can't just let her run around the woods. She's too dangerous. Find some way to contain her power or I will.  Fine. Ugh! Is everybody in this world hiding something? It's fun to hide. You're all right. Why can't everybody be honest like you? Maybe I should just go back where I belong. Wait! Do you mean baby jail? I don't know, man. Mm Fighting Snow-a-constrictors really helped take my mind off things.  So, uh, why am I here, again? Oh, I just wanted to measure Flame Princess's reaction when confronted by the guy who broke her heart. Hey, Cinnamon Bun, I'm  Cinnamon Bun! There's a note. "Gone to Fire Kingdom. Please watch dog." Well, this is terrible. If Flame Princess goes back there, her evil Dad will lock her up again. And if she's imprisoned, I won't be able to complete my tests and I'll have wasted my precious time! We got to save her. Let's doogie! State your business here, and be quick about it. Sorry. I'm on edge 'cause I'm worried that Jerry here will find out I'm dating his sister. Listen, we need to get into the castle right now. Yeah, but why?  So I can go to your mama's house! Now get out of my way. Doesn't your mom live in a nursing home? Yeah. And in a different city. Come on, dude. You got to be honest here. Honest my fist! Come on, Princess. Oh, yeah! Gonna scramble you and fry you up for brunch! I'm trying to act tough, but I really wanted to be a chef. Man. Halt. What is your business here? I need to get inside to file my taxes. Also, I like using the bathroom here. Also, I like to crop dust the lobby. Pass, friend. All right. So, you want to get nasty? One time I blew a snot bubble that broke off and floated away. Then it some lady's baby in the face, and it started crying. And I really enjoy the taste of envelopes. Uh, that's cool and all, but you still haven't told us why you want to get in. We need to see the King? Well, why didn't you just say so? Right this way, friends. Here you go. The new Flame King. Flame Princess? Finn? You're okay! Um, how's it going? Pretty good. Cinnamon Bun and I staged a coup and overthrew my Dad.  Oh, that's why the guards were wigging out. That is the new way in Fire Kingdom. Total honesty is the law of the land. No secrets. Oh. FLAME KING: Right. Can you believe this nonsense? Once I get out of here, I'm gonna ground you for real. No snacks, no friends, no popular music. You never let me have any of those things! You were a selfish King and a bad parent. But I did it for you, honey. For you not to overthrow me like you just did. You belong in that lamp! And if you don't settle down, you'll have to answer to Cinnamon Bun. Hi. Wow. She's even awesomer than I remember. Take off that silly hat. We're going home. No. Look! Got a real dog now.  Flame Princess, listen, I'm really sorry I lied and hurt your feelings, and I was a big, fat jerk. Finn, it's okay. It's in the past now. So, does that mean we're still going out? No. I've realized my place is here ruling these weak and vicious fire people. I see. But we're cool. You're welcome to come back and hang out whenever you like if you promise me one thing. Anything. That you'll be completely honest with me.  Okay. I promise.  I'm serious. Hmm.    This party is so crazy!


  Yee-ow! Whoops. And I dub thee sir Jake the dog. You two now comprise the royal guard of the one true Princess of Ooo That's me! As such, you may no longer own property or operate children and must render all treasure and wives unto your sworn princess within a hangman's fortnight. Joke's on you, man. We spent all our treasure the other day Plus, don't even have any wives. Wait, what? What about Lady? Lady's my girlfriend. Wait, but That was tree trunks. Oh, yeah! We, the inhabitants of Ooo, owe you heroes our very lives. As the once powerful and dignified Princess Bubblegum sulked off into exile, it fell upon you two to save us from the impending comet of doom and/or from the hideous Orgalorg, who aimed to eat the powerful comet and grow invincible! And for that, we are eternally grateful. I know I am. But now your bravery is essential to a new heroic task! Can you guess what it is? Uh Come on. Guess! Um Fight a Fight a dragon? Wrong! Follow me. Man, this is stupid as heck. I miss P.B. Yeah, I guess. Phew! I mean, except for this sweet armor, though. This armor's hot like fire. Nah. The armor's stupid, too. Dang King of Ooo, going around like D.J. Snappy. This is it, fellas The only spot in the kingdom left unscoured during my treasure census. I'm afraid it'll explode or something if I open it. But I really think there could Nay, there might Be precious treasures in there, so I want you two to do it. Man, this seems like a really bad idea. Yeah, well, it's an order from your princess. Git, git, git! Hey! Come on! All right, all right! Hello. We are the sworn protectors of the forbidden inner sanctum, heh. Uh, to proceed, you must answer this ancient riddle. I forgot the riddle. That's okay. I love you. I love you, too. Hey, there's stairs back here. I love you guys. Oh. Whoa! Wait up. It's a dragon A candy dragon. Look. He sucks the vitamins from the roots and transforms it into candy juice. And then And then the juice goes in all those drains. This This is the lifeblood of the whole kingdom! Power, defense, recreation This is everything! -  Mo-mo-mo-money  - It cleans, it nourishes, and, and  Mo-mo-money, money, money Mo-mo-mo-money, money  Go on. What are you talking about with all this money talk? Yeah, why are you singing the money song? What, you don't see it? They don't see it. Look, everyone needs juice to live, right? And I control the source of the juice. So by me charging a mere pittance for every single drop, I can easily quadruple my treasure pile! Man, if you think we're just gonna stand here and Although If this dragon thing could pick up the pace a bit, we could have enough of a surplus left over to export worldwide! Hey! You there! What do you think about picking up the Looks like the Candy Kingdom Empire is finished. But the four of us will live like kings till the juice runs out. What do ya say, boys, let's Oh. I wonder where they ran off to. Princess, princess, princess! Princess! Princess, princess, princess, princess! - Oh, hey, boys! - Princess! Skliz is really blizzed up with the King of Ooo! He really blizzed up all the skliz! He blizzed it all up, man. Yeah, well, maybe he should unblizz it, then. Why do I always got to unblizz everything? But, princess, under the tree, there's There's a dragon, and he took the juice. Oh, no. This is all my fault! Neddy. Princess? Princess, what is it? That dragon you saw, he's my brother, Neddy. - Wha-a-a-a-a?! - Wha-a-a-a-a?! We spawned together from the mothergum. And now I'm all he has. Neddy's very sensitive. It's not safe for him out there. He needs my help, and I'll need yours. Wuh-oh. Aaah! Ah! Hmm? Hmm? It's pretty quiet, huh?! Okay, guys, Neddy's in this cave. I know because my bod-rod here is calibrated to our sister/brother bond. Now, people frighten him, so I'm going in alone. If he tries to run, stop him. I don't think we can, he's a giant Yup! Thanks, guys! This armor is driving me nuts! No way! I changed my mind. I feel like a fancy shield. Or if I was like a dangerous candlestick. Like, a knight's candlestick. You don't stretch, man. This thing's crampin' my crimps! Whoo! Dude, I don't like that. Aah! Neddy, you sweet weirdo. Ooh! Ooh! Oh, no! I just want consistency! If the King of Ooo tries to come here again, you have my secret permission to stop him. No holds barred Moosewood stadium freestyle. So what are you two up to now? Eh, guarding stuff, I guess. Um hey, Bonnie? You always act like a-a loner, right? But next to your brother, you're the light of the party. Sorry, the light of the party. I mean, yeah. One of the first things I did after making sure Neddy was safe was to start making the candy people. I was formed in the Mothergum. My mind and my gum were in touch with dozens of others like a crowded womb. I guess I miss that. But Neddy's from the same place you're from, and he's a wet hot dog around everyone! People get built different. We don't need to figure it out, we just need to respect it. Maybe he likes his own company better than I like mine. Well, do you miss the candy people? Hey, babaloos. Good thing that juice is back on. I was making a mint, but hoo, doggy My candles were starting to turn. Thanks, Jake. That's the stuff. Hey, do you know if I can drink this? Like, is it like well water Good for bathing, but not so good for drinking? You know what? I'm going for it. Yep. It tastes just like you'd think.


Jake, what am I supposed to be meditatin' about? Don't know. I'm thinkin' of pillows stuffed with spaghetti. Clear your minds. I have to go check on something! Can we go with? Perhaps you are ready to go with. Guys, you'll need to put these on. Pull back your hat. Neat! Stay close to me. Whoa! At the heart of this tree is an ancient evil, held in a prison of Amber the Lich! What's that sound? He's casting spells trying to get in your head and control your bod. But these gems are protecting our minds from his influence. If we lost the gems, we'd be defenseless. He would have full control over us. That's freakin' nuts. Beyond Iceberg Lake lies the ruins of the Lich's tower, where he was converting the planet's life-force into unholy power to destroy all of Ooo. But before he could, the Legendary Billy attacked him and pummeled him into the resin of this tree. I What the nuts?! Dude, be a big sword! Oh! Okay. I'll try. Quickly, to the other secret room! There's only one known weapon that can harm the Lich The gauntlet of the hero. Billy! Billy's big ol' beef fingers! Finn, you have but one chance. While the Lich isn't at full power, you must smite him with this gauntlet. His only desire is to destroy life. If you fail, he'll kill everyone! No! That will not happen! Oh, there's something else that I want you to have. The Lich's lair is supposed to be cold. I just don't want you to get sick. Take this sweater. I made it myself. I'm not great at knitting, but please wear it. I care about you, Finn. I love it! Me, too. Hey, hey,hey! So, I've been thinking about this a lot lately. And, well, uh Ooh! Gosh, I'm so nervous. Finn and Jake, will you give me your blessing so I can marry Princess Bubblegum? What is wrong with you?! What's wrong with me?! No! Not the latch! Quickly now, Finn. Track the Lich by his trail of death. Here I go! Here I go! Be safe! This is our first "fate of the world" deal. Yeah, man. We got to shut this fool down, hardcore. Running this fast makes my stomach hurt. Run through it, man! We got to get beyond Iceberg Lake before the Lich! Oh, my! How clumsy of me! What the heck, Ice King?! Ooh! Hey! Wait you guys. I'm serious about Bubblegum. Look, I wrote her name all over my arms and legs! Yuck! Guys? It's not fair! She always hangs out with you. And it's not like you want to marry her. Why are you following us?! Whoa! I told you already! I want your blessing so I can marry Princess Bubblegum! Come on, you guys. Give me permission to marry her. I'll -- I'll -- I'll do a little dance for you. Hmm? You like this? No! Oh. Come on! If you bless our wedding, then maybe she'll really love me. Ice King, go away, man! I will!

  One free-range humpty dumpty. Sorry. Fine aged cheddar man. Homemade ketchup. A fresh pepper fart. Dance, parsley. Face bread. Special sentient sandwich. Is that special sentient sammich? Bingo. Made by the BMO. BMO, you're my little cherub. You know that? You made all this for me, right? Aaahhh. Not so fast, Jake! Naaaw. The sammiches are yours For a price. What? I need you to be my tiny horse for the day, so I can do my live-action cowboy role-play adventure. No way. Poo deal. I'll do 20 minutes. It took me over six hours to prepare this nosh Jake! Not to mention the time it took acquiring the ingredients through the "special market," putting my safety and my reputation on the line. Okay, fine, fine. Three sammiches for every hour I'm a horse. One sammich per horse-hour, six-hour minimum. Deal. Yippee-ki-yay! Yeah. It tastes alive. Steed yourself, partner. Okay. 'Kay. Come on, man. You didn't even try. I did try. Horses are hard. How's that? It reads. Steady, girl. Wha Shh, shh, shh. I'm going to mount you now. Hup! Good girl. So, what's the plan anyway, BMO? The plan is to punch the toads to the stump and bring justice to the peeps! And by the way, Jake, from now on, you can call me Angel Face. Hyah! Yow! I used to be a guy who ran from glob with the wind at my back and the devil on my shoulder. Now I'm the guy chasing those guys, yet the devil is still here, sleeping in my couch. BMO, that hurt when you dug your boots into my side belly. Are you gonna apologize or Horses do not talk. Over there! Hyah! Whoa! Jackrabbit Johnson. This guy's wanted for stealing piglets from their mothers while they are feeding. Makes me sick. He was last seen in Dead Goat Gulch. What do you say, girl? Want to catch this donkey and split the reward? You have 45 minutes left before my next sammich. Time's a-wasting! Hyee! BMO, I'm tired. Looks like my horse needs a rest. Slow down, horse.  Being a robot cowboy Is a lonely job But somebody has to protect the piglets I got nobody but my horse And my friend the cactus guy It's okay because I like them a lot That's okay, I like being a robot Cowboy  Be careful, Jake. This is where Jackrabbit Johnson's gang of lowlife bandits lays low. Hyah! Bang! Bang! Put them up, partner! Hyah! Pyew, pyew! Pyew, pyew, pyew! I want answers! You can't do this to us! No answers? No use to me! How about you, Frisco? I'm not going to talk. Why am I talking to you then?! Hooah! Yah! Unh! BMO, what did you do? It's Jackrabbit Johnson's right-hand man, Tumbleweed Terk. I spent the last three months building all of this. That's where you been? BMO gave me a Finn cake. Don't talk to my horse, Tumbleweed. Where is Jackrabbit Johnson?! I know you know where he's headed. I don't know! Tumbleweed Terk's always the last to know. It's just like I told the other bounty Hunter, I swear. I don't believe a word you say. Now take a message to your compadre. Tell him his pal, Angel Face, is itching to get together. Tell Jackrabbit Johnson to meet me at Dirtwater Flats, just like the old days! Okay. Sock citizens of Dead Goat Gulch, we can rebuild! Neigh! Grrr. I don't remember where Dirtwater Flat is. Better stop for the night. We can make a campfire here. And we will talk about what we will do with the reward money. No. It's been fun, BMO, but it's time to go home because there are no more sandwiches. But I want to finish the adventure. Which direction is the house? I'm not sure. Get down! Getting kicked out of the guild of assassins check. Capturing my first bounty Check. Going to Finn and Jake's treehouse and getting revenge Unchecked. Finn and Jake's treehouse? Who are you, and why do you want to get revenge? I Am Me-Mow! Me-Mow?! Whoa. You've gotten bigger. Have we met before? Finn, is that you? That's Jackrabbit Johnson! Finn? It is Finn! Tricked again! Look It's Me-Mow, BMO. I don't care. That's my bounty! Yaah! Jake, transform Horse! Whoa, did you have a real gun all this time? I am old enough to vote. Hey, Jake, if you can hear my internal monologue, I'm going to kill you! Your daisy days are over! I am the whaler 'round these parts! Sounds like you're out of ammo. No, you heard incorrectly. Bang, bang, bang! I'm coming for you! Blast you, Finn and Jake and Angel Face. This prison cell's not going to hold me. Hey, Finn and Jake! I'll get my revenge! You hear me?! Revenge! Hey, BMO, are you sure you took down all the wanted posters? Yes. Stick 'em up. This bounty belongs to me! Get out of here! Yaah! Thanks, BMO. You're welcome.

 Fallen ally, fallen ally, you're home now in the sky Fallen ally, fallen ally, single tear we cry! A truer friend there was none And Prismo was his name An artisan of pickling and now just one remains And now just one  I can't do this, man! It just can't be over! Hey! We can put it back in the fridge if you want. No, these picks were made by our friend to be mouth-loved. We have to honor his memory with a final taste of his genius. Get ready for the dream ritual. Om! Prismo, we love you, forever in our dreams! Prismo, we love you, forever in our dreams! Prismo, we love you, forever in our dreams! Pickle rama! Pickle rama! - Pickle rama! Pickle rama! - Finale! Ommmmmmmm! - Woof! What was that? - Quick! To bed! This has to be the last thing we think about! - Hyah! - Okay Dream! Whoo! Crazy dream, man. Prismo was definitely in it. But Jake? You up already? What the Hup! Ouf! I love you, everything burrito. Jake, why are you pretending to dig up - everything burrito? - Huh? What? Hold on! I'm coming down. - Wuagh! - Jake, you got to hear my dream. Jake? Hey, man! You're shaking it all wrong. - What the jump? - Shh! Let me show you how it's done. Jake, are you sleepwalking? No, I'm showing this Wuaaghh! Waah! Wake Up! - Tunk. I'm not dreaming. - You made an oath. Okay. - Waa! - Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree. Jake! I saw you explode. Something messed up is haps, bro. Please! Not even. No, dude, you blew into chunks right over there. Uh, because kee-oth was right there. And there were traps. And I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it. Jake, this already happened. Come on, man! - Stop freaking me out. - Wuagh! Aw, Jake dust!  Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes Take some bacon, and I put it in a pancake Bacon pancakes, that's what it's gonna make  - * Bacon panca-a-ke! * - Dude, what is the deal? Dude, what is the deal? Dude, I can't wait to get this batch of pickles to Jake. He's totes gonna bust a pipe when he gets hit with the cumin and the undertones of sage that come in later. Prismo, I'm right here! Where you going, bro? Wait up, man! How are you alive? Finn and I saw your old-man host body get destroyed by the - The lich?! - Wake up! Wait! I've changed my mind! Wait! Why is this happening? It's like a rerun of the worst junk. The lich life-sucks Prismo's dream host, which eliminates Prismo forever. Ugh! It's mad griz, bro. And then the space police, or whatever they're called show up because boppin' Prismo was a cosmic crime. I remember feeling like someone had peeled a layer away from my brain, and my reality was no longer anchored to any point of reference. And I had to fight to keep from being crushed under the weight of an unforgiving new paradigm of ultimate reality. - Ouf! - So cool, man! So why am I seeing this again? - Uh That's cool. - Uh, that's cool. But you know what's really cool? Tough-guy contests. Whoo! Whoo! Tough boys! Come on, man! Tough-guy-contest me! Okay. It seems like all of Jake's memories are re-manifesting themselves, but as soon as I break their history, it creates - a paradox and Jake explodes. - Whoa, Finn! How'd you get over there?! Wuagh! Finn, when I die, my individual earth consciousness is gonna go all over everywhere while glob tallies my deeds. - What? - I'm gonna be all around you. In your nose and your dreams and socks. - In your dreams? - Yeah, that's what I said. In your dreams. All this striz happened when Jake and I tried to preserve Prismo's pickles in our dreams. Something must've changed when we went to sleep. So, uh, I just got to hope that Jake tries to do the pickle ritual again, so I can reenact it with him. Exactly the way it happened? Maybe? Geez!  Fallen ally, fallen ally, you're home now in the sky Fallen ally, fallen ally, single tear we cry!  I guess I'm headed towards that door. Dude, I get out of relationships, because I don't want to have a discussion about what we're gonna have for dinner every night. All these dudes and their lady problems. That's right! Prismo is nothing but the dream of - a wrinkly old man. - What if the whole world was just some goof's dream? Man, that would be stupid! Whoa! Oh, wait a minute. What is this? This couldn't be a Oh, grod! Permanent-opposing, industrial-strength magnetic bed. Hand-hewn from a single tree. Oh, man, look at this mattress! What is it? Smells like a blend of cashmere. Mohair, silk, and wool maybe. The thread count on this is in the thousands! And it's filled with Down feathers of a baby griffin! That's illegal! Glass of milk. This feels like a trap designed by some kind of sick genius! Well Hats off to you, sir or madame. Your trap was a success. Oh, my blahs! It's like I'm getting eskimo kisses from an army of angels! Whoa, dang! I'm back! Prismo, we love you, forever in our dreams. Prismo, we love you, forever in our dreams. Prismo, we love you, forever in our dreams. Pickle rama! Pickle rama! Pickle rama! Pickle rama! - Finale! - Ommmmmmmm. - Woof! What was that? - Quick! To bed! This has to be the last thing we think about! - Hyah! - Okay Dream! Whoa! The pickle jar! I'm coming, Jake! - Whoa! Where the heck am I? - Wait up, man! - How are you alive? - Jake?! I'm coming, man! Finn and I saw your old-man host body get destroyed by the Jake! Don't explode! - Finn, hold up. - Prismo! - I saw you die, dude! - Yeah, I'm still dead. I'm actually talking to you from the past. I set up this plan "B" scenario in case I ever got croaked for reals. So if this is happening, I guess I got croaked and my pickles ran out, but Jake and I established a bro bond that could bring me back through his dreams. So are you actually talking to me right now, or are you pretending to in an empty room? I was pretending, but now I can see you. What does "now" mean to you? Uh Hurry up! I need your help. Where you going, bro? Wait up, man! How are you alive? - So, where are we going? - You got to wake up Jake, - and then You'll see. - I'll see what, Prismo? Oh, shoot! I don't know if I thought this - thing all the way through. - What? Aw, d It'll be cool. It'll be cool. Dude, I can't believe I died. Jake, I'm sorry, man. This doesn't feel right. Okay, go wake Jake up and bring him back here. Whoa, Finn! Hey! Are you gonna wake up Jake? Yeah, is that gonna kill you again, though? My past self is doing plan "B," right? Uh, yes. Although, I got to say, this whole thing seems rickety as yoga balls. - Yeah, tell me about it. - You tell you about it! I think you would blow up if I did that. Well, anyway, here we go! Hey, Jake, wake up. - I'm out. - Hey, Finn! - What's going on? - We got to bounce. Oh, bro! Don't tear me away from Nirvana. Wait! Nooooo! Ouf! - I'm okay now. - Cool. This way! Whoa! Oh, wait a minute. - What is this? - Prismo! You're alive! Well, not yet. Finn, in a second, you got to - stop yourself from waking up Jake. - Stop my who? Shoot! Hide! Hey, did we get turned around somewhere? I feel like we're lost. No, I was just stalling. Don't think about it. Come on! This way. That who! But wait, Jake! That means one of your alternate-reality incarnations will sleep for eternity to keep me alive. Cool, dude! Okay, but, Finn, I'm not sure what'll happen if you confront yourself. He might explode. - He me? Or other me? - You know what? Forget it. Shut it, Prismo! Heroes risk everything for their friends, although, I admit you're more Jake's friend than mine. Sometimes you can think someone is totally cool, but you never become besties. And I don't know why that happens, but regardless, - let's do this! - Good luck! Whoa, Finn! Hey! Are you gonna wake up Jake? Yeah, is that gonna kill you again, though? My past self is doing plan "B," right? - Plan "B"! - What the This is me? This sword is me? - Finn sword, dude. - Welcome back, Prismo! - Thank you, Finn. - Welcome back, Prismo! Thank you, Jake.

So, this is the pits. I hear that, friend. Do you mind if I wallow with you a bit? I'm a bubble. Okay. Nothing stopping a bubble. That's what they say. Looks like you've given up on things. I'm thinking about giving up on things myself. I've been lost in this wilderness a long time. Maybe we can wait here to get eaten by a carnivore. No, Bubble. I know two heroes who can help you. - You do? - Yes. Help me get to my home and and we will help you find your home. Your friends sound great! They are! They are huge! Well, then, what are we waiting for? Nothi-i-i-i-ng! Hey, so, tell me about your home, BMO. I live in a tree house. Unh! It's really funny. - Cool. Yeah. Oof! What about your home? My home? I think that my home is very large and very beautiful, but I can't pin down these memories. It haunts me. Oops! I wasn't listening to your story. What was that? It's a carnivore waiting to eat us! - No!! - Don't worry, Bubble. I've got everything under control. Ugh! Ehh. It's a baby! What's a baby doing in the wilderness? He must be lost like us! We should take him with us. Maybe we can help him find his home, too. What a handsome baby. Handsome baby. Bubble, what do you think our baby's name is? How about Sparkle? No, I think he looks like a Ricky. Hmm. Oh! Bubble! Ricky! Look! I have bad news. The bridge doesn't have guardrails. I don't think we should cross it, then. I don't think we have any choice! I'm sure that really is a carnivore this time! Ricky, you should go first! You are so beautiful, and I love you. Go, Ricky! Okay, Ricky, slow and steady! Ricky? Ricky! Ricky!! - Sparkle!! Bravery! Oh, n-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! One second, sweetie! Hmm. A deadly waterfall! BMO! Bubble! You have to save our lives! Ohh maybe I can hold out this leaf. Thank you, Bubble! I think my batteries are wet. Goodbye. Good morning, everyone. I didn't have any dreams. He looks fussy. Maybe he's hungry. My hungry baby. What am I going to do with you? Potato. Eat your potato, Ricky. It's the carnivore! Everybody! Hide! Psst! Ricky! Please! Hide! Ugh! Ungh! Oh, Ricky! Ungh! Help me out here! My baby! I was so worried about you, Sparkle. Sparkle. - No! - Hey! Ricky, no! No, no, no! No! No! BMO, that's his mom! Let go! Ehh My beautiful baby. You should be ashamed of yourself! Vro-o-o-o-om! Zo-o-o-om! Sho-o-o-om! Hey! The path ahead looks pretty clear. And there were these uh, there BMO? Are you okay? I am sad, Bubble. I miss baby Ricky. I miss him so much already. And I miss Finn, and I miss Jake. And I got dirt all in my butt circuits. And, Bubble - Yes, BMO? I-I don't think I'm ever gonna get home again! Don't cry. Sparkle is safe now, and we did that. Thanks to us, he's gonna grow up to be anything he wants to be a strapping horse whisperer or a sexy hit man or whatever. And things are looking up for us, too. I saw some bugs up ahead who look pretty with it. Maybe they can give us directions or something. Oh! Oh, my gosh! Oh! Oh! Oh, Bubble! - What? - I know those guys, Bubble! Those are my homeboys my homeboys! Those are my homeboys! We are close to my home! Yay! Come on, BMO! Yay! Oof! Yay! Yay! It's been so long! I can't wait to have some bread and butter! Jake? Is that you at the door? No, man. I'm in the kitchen, making us breakfast. I call not-answer-the-door, then. Oh, all right! Hang on out there. I'm coming. Whoop! Whoa! Argh! Agh! Whoa! Yaaaaaaaah! Might be a minute. Um, hey, so, BMO, since we have a little time, there's something I've been wanting to say. Huh? I know I might never find my real home. No, Bubble! That's not true! It is. I know it is. But it's it's okay. Because I realized something. All this time we've been together, BMO, I haven't felt lost. I've felt at home. Yaaaaaaaah! And it's you, BMO, I feel at home with. So, I thought I mean, if you feel the same way I thought we could get married. I-I mean, I'm not even sure what that means exactly, but I do! Oh, I do! I do! Oh! - Whoooooo! - Hey, a Bubble! Pop! Bubble? Bubble?! No! No, no, no! My bubble! No! - What's so funny? - Oh, it's just BMO. He's pretending to be all messed up 'cause his bubble got popped. Ohhh. That is pretty funny! Oh, Bubble, I'm so sorry I brought you here. There, there, BMO. It's okay. Bubble? Is that you? I hear you in my head, but I don't see you. Oh, no. Have I gone bananas? No, BMO. It's okay. You see, I'm finally free. I don't understand, Bubble. No, not Bubble. Air. BMO, I'm Air! I'd been trapped in that bubble for so long, I'd forgotten who I am. But now I'm finally home. Yay! Oh. B-But wait. Now you don't need me to feel at home. No. See, that's what's so great. Now we can be together forever, BMO every minute of every day. No more privacy. No more quiet. No more alone. Every room you ever go in, I'll already be there waiting forever and ever until the end of time. Yayyyyyyy!  


You want some more eggs, beemo? - Yes, please. - How about you, finny? - Need a refill? - I'm pretty full, man, but let me see if I can Rearrange. - Nope. Can't do it. - I don't know if - stomachs work like that, dude. - Sometimes it helps. Can't argue with that. Eee, eee! Ahh. Ahh. Ahh. Ohh. Hello. Lady, it's gonna be fine. Mm-hmm. All right, I love you, too. - Bye. - Lady rainicorn again? Yeah, man. She's worried about introducing me to her parents at lunch today. She thinks they're gonna "freak out." UmMaybe give her parents some treasure? No way! That's our treasure! Wait. I've got it, dude! I'll invite them over early, "smoove" them over using my personality, and we'll all be best friends before lady gets here so she doesn't have to feel nervous. It's perfect. I'll just send them a quick prism-gram. Mm-hmm. - What's it say? - Hold on. Still converting the light waves into brain waves. Aaaah. They're into it, dude! Sweet! Let's go powder our noses! - Why's lady so nervous, anyway? - Well, she didn't really say, but it might have something to do with the rainicorn/dog - wars. - There were wars between - rainicorns and dogs? - Horrifying wars. For thousands of years, rainicorns battled dogs over territory in the crystal dimension. - But lady and I are cool. - Dude! Her parents are probably all full of dog hatred from the war times! They're gonna see you're a dog and forbid lady from ever hanging out with you again! Nah. That could never happen. You didn't think this through enough. - It could happen! - Waaah! - I'm a moron! - Don't worry. I've got a plan that's gonna solve this biz. - Homeys help homeys.

New plan. First, we're gonna clean this place up, and then -- Jake? Aah! Let's hide and burn the house down! - Hello? - Annyong. Haseyo. Jake, is that you? Uh-huh. Are you going to let us in? Yeah.

It's awesome to finally meet you both. - Your house is very colorful. - Ha! The plan is working, homey. Jake, what is that thing - that's talking? - UhThat's, um I'm Jake's rainicorn roommate.

I'm glad the wife and I made the trip from the crystal dimension. Yes, we're eager to know more about the studly young rainicorn that's dating our daughter. - Ethel. - Well, ask me whatever you like, Ethel, Bob. I am a little curious about your goblin. He looks a little odd. Well, he's actually a human. Oh, Bob! Our future son-in-law must be filthy rich to afford a human Butler! Shh. Thank you, Jake, for being - interested in our daughter. - UhNo problem, Bob. Oh! Oh! Let's play some traditional rainicorn games! Jake, do you know - kabaladapawumba-pbht! - Uh S-say it again?

I've never tasted real human before, but they say you can't even tell the difference. Ew. Soy? Finn, you're delicious! Oh, man!


     Hurry, Lady! Oh, it's happening again. PRINCESS BUBBLEGUM: That's right, Finn. Princess! The zombie infection has spread across the kingdom once again. And once again, it's all my fault. PRINCESS BUBBLEGUM: I was testing a sample of the zombie flesh I had saved when Cinnamon Bun came into the lab. He said he was hungry. I'm hungry- Not now, Cinnamon Bun. I'm busy. PRINCESS BUBBLEGUM: And that's when I made my mistake. I should have paid more attention to that poor fool. Huh?  Mmm!  PRINCESS BUBBLEGUM: The candy-zombie flesh he ingested was highly contagious.  Cinnamon Bun? Where did you -- eeek!  Sugar! I escaped, but I wasn't able to stop Cinnamon Bun from infecting the rest of the kingdom. The good news is I still have all my notes for making the antidote formula. Oh, sweet! Let's board up the windows, then we can get started. Owww! Aaaah! Princess! Don't worry, Finn. You have the notes for my formula. Just let Science do the work. Science is mmmmoraaaah! Noooo! LSP: Get that zombie out of here! Oh, no. I am not getting eaten by zombies tonight.  Get the lump out of here! Oh, Princess! These notes make no sense. It's all gobbledy gak. We'll each make our own version of the formula. One of us is bound to get it right.  Hmm? Hey, Princess Bubblegulm trained her rat to dance. Neat!  Ah! All right! Ahh. Oh, yes!  Done! Done! BOTH: Done! Bubblegum, I'm coming for you!  Mine first. BOTH: Aah!  Rarr! TOGETHER: Sugar! Cram! STARCHIE: Oh, my! That's a lot of zombies down there. Starchy's glad he's up here,  Doot do-do-doo  Aah! Daaaaaaang itttttttttt! - Aah! - Let's get out of here! Upstairs!  Jake, try yours and Lady's next. Move out of the way! My formula is going to cure the zombies because I made the prettiest formula.  Aah! Ohm my glob! Look at those luscious lips! I got to go lick up the rest of that formula. Aaaaaaaaaaah! My formula!  Formula! Oh, my glob! Yes! I'm gonna be so hot! So freaking hot!  Yeah! LSP, look out! Huh? I know you want this body, but you can't have it! You can't have it!  Oww! BOTH: Aah! LSP! Dang it, Jake. We only got one formula left. Try yours and Lady's. Right. Let's hope this works. BOTH: Aah! Whe-- where now? We can barricade ourselves in the lab.  Did anyone get bit? I think we're good. That door's made out of candy steel. - Aaah! - What's the matter?  FINN: Jake! Did he get you? I think I'm okay. It's just a little bite. Uh Aah! - Jake! - It's all good, sweetie. I can stretch forever.  Hey, let's hurry up with that antidote, huh, pal? Oooooooooooohhhhhhh. Okay, let's see here. Nyah, nyah, nyah. Try one of them books over by the lab rat. Ha! Yeah, okay! Yes! This book is a glossary of symbols.  That's great, buddy.  Jake, I think this little guy's got serious dance fever.  Don't come near me, sweetie.  Oh, man. I'm out of shape. I think I should just stay in here. You know just in case. Uh-oh! Hurry, dude! - I am! Okay, Jake's probably gonna turn into a zombie, which is okay. I just have to figure out this formula. Jake? Jake?  Jake! Hang on, Lady. I'll have the antidote soon. But whatever you do, just don't let him out. He might look like the Jake that once loved you, but he's just a zombie. Hey, Lady. Aah! BOTH:  The book!   Sorry, everybody. Sorry, LSP, P.B., Jake, L.R., Peepee, Poopoo, Doodoo.  You know, it's funny. I don't even know your name.  Yeah? What is it, girl? Sci ence? Your name is Science? Could it be? Just let Science do the work. Science is mmmmoraaaah! Hmm. Is that it'?  Here goes nothing.  Finn! Jake! You did it! I -- huh? Uh-oh. Aaah!  Don't worry, Science. I've got a disgusting idea. Oh, my glob! I'm sorry about the whole biting thing. No, you weren't yourself. It was really nothing personal.  Sorry about biting you, sugar. Oh! And so the royal day of apologizing has come to an end. And now I shall present the royal medal for heroic bravery. Finn the human! - Yes? Would you please move out of the way? Science the rat, you have served your kingdom well. Citizens of Candy Kingdom, rejoice!  Rejoice!  Rejoice! 


     FINN: oh, it's just my luck oh, it's just my luck I went on a walk and I found a truck oh, it's just my luck oh, it's just my luck when I honk this horn I'll wake Jake up Jake, wake up! I found a truck! JAKE: What? What's happening? JAKE: Whoa! Where did you get this baby? FINN: I found it in the woods. I named itHot Daniel. Anyway, I figure we can do some pretty sick stuff with it. JAKE: Oh, yeah? Like what? FINN: Mm, I don't know. Launch it off some ramps, maybe get it going 30 Miles per hour, crank the wheel into a gnar right-hander, spray dirt everywhere, like a big hirkin' dirt-wave. JAKE: Yeah, buddy! Nice! Let's crank this beast up! FINN: Can't. Engine's busted, I think. JAKE: Nuts. Bmo, you know anything about cars?  Nope. FINN: Hmm. Maybe Ice king, you know anything about cars?! ICE KING: Nope, not a car guy. Too confusing. Got better things to do with my life. FINN: Mm. JAKE: Wait, I know someone who's good with mechanics. Hey! Hey, guys! Hi! Hey! JAKE: Hey, banana man. Wow! I haven't seen you fellas since you destroyed my home, my land, and my rocket. FINN: Oh, geez, yeah. Sorry, banana man. Just sort of happened. Don't worry about it. Bygones. I'm just excited you called me over. We're neighbors. We should help each other out. I got the soda and the jams. ALL: Cool! I see the problem. The top of your engine is gone, specifically the cylinder head. FINN: Hmm. Okay. That word sounds cool. But what does it mean? Let me explain. The cylinder head is the top to the cylinder block. Think of the cylinder head as an airtight lid to your engine that regulates air, fuel, and exhaust. FINN: Okay, cool. Informative. What is he pointing at? Now, this lid is important because it works to get fuel into your engine.  You see, your engine has cylinders, and in these cylinders are pistons.  When the piston in the cylinder moves down, it creates a vacuum, pulling in fuel from the intake. You mean an air-fuel mixture? That's right, bmo. Have a gold star, dear. Yay! Bmo is so pretty and smart! Then the piston returns to the top, compressing the air-fuel mixture. Then, a spark plug fires off, creating an explosion, driving the piston back down, powering the engine.  FINN: Sweet. So where's the cylinder head, then? Hmm. Well, sometimes people store parts they are working on in the car. Ah! Bingo! Found it. FINN: Yeah! Drive time! Well, not quite. We don't know why they took the cylinder head off. It could be cracked, the gasket head could be warped, the rod bearings could have damage from water. You see, that's the cool thing about cars.  One tiny little thing messes everything else up, so nothing works. So it's up to us to figure it out! FINN: Cool. JAKE: Yeah, all right.  fixing a truck with the neighbors not a better way to spend some time hoping to see if they like me using automotive savvy do a good job they'll give me props  Bam!  I'm asked to come back tomorrow a future I see with them and me, best buds hanging out forever board-game Friday nights hanging out forever best-friend pillow fights hanging out forever board-game Friday nights hanging out forever best-friend pillow fights  JAKE: Whew! I'm bushed. You guys want to pick this up again in the morning? FINN: Sure. Sounds good. Not bmo. This grease monkey's torqued up on automotive science. Yeah, boyee! FINN: Okay, bmo. Good night, banana man. Have a good evening, gents.  Time for the night shift. It's 10 past the hour, and this is "graveyard shift," hosted by me, starchy the gravedigger, your weekly five-hour dose of all the strange haints, phantasmagoria, and phenomena I see workin' in the candy kingdom graveyard. Hello, caller. You're on the "graveyard shift." Wha-- am I -- oh, hi. Um, long-time listener, first-time caller. So, um, I think princess bubblegum has been replaced by, like, a lizard person. A lizard? Yeah, a lizard. I love your show! Oh, starchy's very interested in this topic. What led you to this discovery, caller? Ha! They are wrong! You look more like a hippo than a lizard. Well, um, my friend is a very highly placed official in the candy kingdom, and I've noticed -- hi, bmo. Yow! Stay back, lizard! Oh, sorry, bmo. I didn't mean to startle you. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the truck. And biodiesel! Oh! And I figured out what's wrong with the engine block. So, what are you working on? Aerodynamics. Swe-e-e-e-et. You know, it's been really nice hanging with you fellas and working on the car It gets a little lonely at my space-age banana dome. You don't have a girlfriend? No. I -- I don't want to be alone, but, uh I've gotten pretty good at it. I putter around the house, keeping busy with my little projects. But it would be nice to find someone. Hold up. Princess, is that you?  Oh, spooky. FINN: Yo, bmo, coffee. Thank you. FINN: Car looks nice, bmo. JAKE: Yeah.  Oh, aah! I fixed it! Are we best friends yet?! Oh. Oh, hey. I-I fixed it. FINN: Ni-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-ce. I discovered the cylinder head was warped, so I went to the junkyard and got a new one. Bingo. FINN: Whoo.  JAKE: Biodiesel!  ALL: Yeah!  Whoo-hoo! FINN: Awes-o-o-o-ome!  Yowee wow.  She's beautiful. JAKE: Well, then go over and talk to her! Yeah. Come on, banana man. You're lonely! Oh, no. That's okay. Having someone to love takes up time I could use to work on stuff. JAKE: That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Pardon me, miss. My friend here is super-smart, and he rebuilt this truck. He's very smart and very single. Okay JAKE: Anyway, his name is banana man. If you like what you see, give him a call.   BUBBLEGUM: Help m-e-e-e-e-e! FINN: We got to save bubblegum! No, finn! She's a lizard! JAKE: You got to stop listening to all those conspiracy shows. They twist up your noodle so you can't tell what's real. FINN: Look, there she is! BUBBLEGUM:  Whoa! JAKE: You want some tea? BUBBLEGUM:  Sure.  Thanks, Jake. FINN: So, what's up with the angry mob, pb? BUBBLEGUM:  They think I've been replaced with an evil lizard replicant. It's sheer nonsense. Eat this bug! Lizard!   FINN: Punch it, 'Nana man! Whoa, whoa, whoa! FINN: Hyah!  BUBBLEGUM: What the fridge? Whoa! BUBBLEGUM: Finn, Jake! Reptilian synthoid replicants are trying to take over the kingdom! FINN: Yeah, we know. Kill it! BUBBLEGUM: No! No! I'm the real one!  Hey, speedy. Unh! You're coming with me. What? Really? Mm-hmm. 'Cause you ain't got enough peel on that nanner. You're under arrest for public indecency! JAKE: Bye, banana man! It's not fair! BUBBLEGUM: It's okay, bmo. It's a very mild offense. It's not like that. Hot Daniel is dead! JAKE:  Loot, bro! FINN: Gear dumped, bro! How about this room, bro? JAKE: Looks like a brolicious room to relax in and play video gamesBro. FINN: Home sweet home, bro. ICE KING: Yeah, you said it. I've been home this whole time. JAKE:  I keep forgetting that he lives here now. FINN: Just until Gunther finishes rebuilding the ice kingdom. ICE KING: What y'all whispering about? Hee-hee! Ex-squeeze me. JAKE: Ice king, we've told you a thousand times. This couch ain't for cuddling. ICE KING: Sure it is. JAKE: It isn't! ICE KING: Mm, it's cozy. FINN: It's not that bad, Jake. ICE KING: See? JAKE:  Finn, can I speak to you in the kitchen? ICE KING: Oh, hey, Jake. Can you bring me a sandwich?  Sandwich? JAKE: It's time to kick ice king out! Huh! ICE KING: Don't forget the bread! Ha ha! FINN: Look, I hear you, but we can't kick him out because, well, I still feel guilty about junking up his crib. Hey, what if we check him into a hotel room? JAKE: Hmm. FINN: What's that? JAKE: Checking into a hotel room. ICE KING: Ooh, sandwich time!  FINN: Hey, Simon, how would you like to stay in the coolest hotel? JAKE: Lumpy space princess stays there. That's how cool it is. FINN: We'll even put you up for a few weeks until your place is ready. ICE KING: Oh, but that sounds lonely. I'd just like to stay here with you guys. Having roommates is nice. Keeps me out of my head. Gunther only says "wenk." What's up with that? FINN:  Yeah. JAKE: Finn, I'm ready to murder the ice king. FINN: No. Uh, I have another idea.  ICE KING:   Oop.  FINN: Oh, my gosh! Someone's at the door. We have a doorbell now. We'll get it! BOTH: Abracadaniel? FINN: What are you doing here? What? You kept calling and ca-- JAKE:  Shut the hupbububup, abracadeez! FINN: Yeah, man. You don't even need a reason to stop by. JAKE: A sexy wizard like you goes where he wants. ICE KING: Whoa.

Are you really afraid of the dark? Maybe? FINN: Okay, well, you can sleep on the couch. We're gonna go. Uh, good night.  Whoa! ICE KING: See? I told you. Isn't it awesome? Since I'm pretty much in charge here, we could totally take all this treasure if we wanted to. Ha! Totally. Wow! Cool! ICE KING: Oh, that's just a binklemyer. Oh. ICE KING: Want to see something really cool? Yeah. ICE KING: Okay, but you got to promise not to freak out. This is Joshua the dog's demon-blood sword.  ICE KING: Yeah, it's a real demon-blood sword. Whaaaaaaat? ICE KING: And you see these words? If you say them out loud, you can actually see a vision of the demon whose blood was used to make the sword. No way! That sounds awesome. Too bad neither of us can read demon runes. ICE KING: Ooh, I know how! "Booty rum lac soo ree po kee oth prandium." Like that.  ICE KING: Oops. Wow! It looks so real! I am real! BOTH: Aaaaaaaaaah! Bring me the true bearer of my blood sword or I will destroy you both!  ICE KING: Come on, best friend! Let us not betray finn. Let's fight kee oth ourselves! Nobody can defeat us if we work together. Super wizard team up! ICE KING: Hwah! Floriana! ICE KING: Raaa! You're wasting your powers on me! Ha ha! ICE KING: Oh! No! Oh, no! He's too powerful!  BOTH: Kee oth! Joshua! BOTH: Kee oth rama pan Don't say another word, Joshua. Or their throats are going to get it! If you speak the words to banish me, I'll reduce your friends to ash. JAKE: Kee oth rama-- FINN: Dude! JAKE: Thought he was bluffing. I'm not bluffing, Joshua! If you do not willingly return my stolen blood, I will destroy him and him! FINN: Ah! The sword! JAKE: Scary!  FINN: I just can't do it, Jake. This is dad's sword! JAKE: You don't have any other choice. Do it! Do it! Do it! FINN:  Whoa, bro. You got your blood. Now get out of here! All right, I'll go. Psych! Got you now, Joshua! JAKE: Ah!  Uh, hey. So, I-I should be getting home. ICE KING: Uh, yeah. Me too. Hey, abracadaniel, you want to hang out at my place? I thought your house broke. ICE KING: Psh. Ice kingdom's been rebuilt for weeks. FINN: Jake?  


  Aw, yes! The storm has passed! Jake! Hoo! Hoo. Jake. Nachos. Nachos. I love nachos. I love nachos even more while looking out the window. Hmm. Does that box have a face on it? A face gotta make sure. There's a box outside with a face on it! It might be a box man. He's all soggy and dirty. Want to check it out? Naw. 'Chos! I'm gonna check it out. - Yeah, whatever. Hmm. Where'd your face go? Whoa! Okay. Shh. Are you lost, little cardboard dude? Jake! There seems to be a lost cat bumping around in a box! Yeah, that's great. Get it out of here! Getting no help from him, I guess. Do you know where your home is? Okay. I'll follow you. Whoa. Is this your kingdom? It's wonderful! That must be your prince. Huh? Huh? A prince wouldn't steal from his subjects. Aww! Switched? Of course! You must be the real prince, and that thief took your place! Is that right, little prince? Don't worry, your majesty. I'll help you reclaim your kingdom. Why do you hate cats, Jake? Move your face. You're messing up the game. Anyway, I don't want to talk about it. It's personal. Cats know what they did. Aah! Aah! Is Jake okay? No! I'm pretty dang far from okay! There's a little shard of tortilla chip caught between my teeth. First, we have to expose the traitor's deception. Hmm. Aha. That's a counterfeit crown, hewn from the liar's own boxflesh. Hmm. It looks like your crown was torn off by some ah! Your crown was lost, you say? During the storm? The same storm that sent you hurtling through the woods? Until you were delivered unto my doorstep? Right. So it's definitely in the woods somewhere. All we have to do is find your crown to prove to the people that you're the real prince. Mm. Um I'm gonna wait over by the gates, your highness. Mm-nah, mm-nah, mm-nah. Get big and the chip will fall out of your teeth. Ha! You think I can stretch out of everything? You're so naive. To live life, you need problems. That's stupid! If you get everything you want the minute you want it, what's the point of living? Come on, dude. It's time for your vitamins. Okay. So let's retrace your steps. Do you remember which path you took? Prince? Whoa! You found it already! Good work, team! Ow! Quit that! Come on. You're a prince. Come, your majesty. It's time. People of the Box Kingdom! I have found your true prince! J'accuse! What? They they don't believe us. Mm. The rain lumped up your complexion all hobo-like. They're not looking past the surface grunk. Hmm? Oh, no. He's challenging you to a joust! We better find you a lance. Did it come out? You've forgotten the most important part, my impatient little friend a thorough rinsing. Well? Bleh. Nothing. I need, like, a toothpick or something. I told you to buy floss. Floss is for losers. Oh, one of these will do nicely. You put cards in your mouth? Just the edge, kid. And then I work it like a pro. Now to find the card that best suits my devil-may-care personality. Trial by combat shall prove which prince is true! This town's gone nuts! Hey, Beemo! Ta-da! You did it, Jake! Congratulations! How did you get that piece of tortilla chip out of your teeth? Oh, I didn't. It's still there. It'll be like a constant reminder of what life's all about. This is unsatisfying. Zip it! Hyah! Bad! Bad princes! Which is which? Aww! This is the one! This is your prince! Um or maybe this is the one! Hmm. Is this is this even a kingdom? Aww! Aww. Hey, hey! Oh, you guys! Aww, cut it out! Aww! Oh! Ah!    - This party is so crazy!


      Who wants a cookie?  Milk-dipped chocolate-chip cookie! No, thanks. Now, come on, Finn. You ha ve to eat. Open sesame! Uh, Jake can't we get rid of these clown nurses? They make me feel ridiculous. No way, man. Ugh! Well, now you know we can't jump off of birds.  I paid them up front. They don't leave until the job's done. Besides  they're funny.  Look! She just farted! Time for our love therapy. Wait -- what are they doing?  Whoa! Stop! Oh, my! Did that hurt, dear? No! I just don't want you kissing my toe! Now, now, honey. You got to understand that this is the only way to foo-foo your boo-boo. What does that even mean?! I don't know, but I'm feeling better already. Aah! That tickles. You want me to stop? No, keep going.  You're gross, man. Look! "Deep in the forest of trees, there's a Cyclops whose magical tears can heal any wound." See? See?! Maybe you should leave the medical decisions to the medical professionals. And my professional prescription is your toe needs c-razy smooches! It's the only way!  Huh? What?! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! There's another way! There's my way! Let me show you my way!  Aah! Let me go!  Aaaaaaaah! Whoa! Oof! Huh? It's the only way!  Whoa! Waah! Waah!  Whoa!  It's the only way. Aaaaaaah! My way!  Hmm. Ring! Ring! Look, there's only two choices, bro. Take your pick. There's a path on the left -- "Hair Fall Out path," no more hair again e ver! Or the path on the right -- "Smelly path," makes you smelly forever.  You won't believe it. Isn't there another way? No. - What if I just went -- - No. That's it. You have to choose. There's no other way. Choosing is the only way.  Choosing is the only way. It's the only way!  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Hey, listen, man -- The Smelly Path's actually not that bad. Uhuhh No! I choose my way! Aaaaah! My way.  Hmm. Ring! Ring! Hello, dummy police? Yes, there's a strange dummy lurking around my house. Okay. Yes. Thank you. Goodbye. What? I need to cross the river. The cyclops is over there. You can't cross this river. It's impossible. Look, the current -- it's so fast, it'll turn your butt inside out for real, doofus. And the water's so acidic, it'll krump your boat in half. It's like orange juice. It's gross. There's a bridge, but it's a trap. Plus, the water's jammin' with electric eels! Wow. So weird. Anyway, that's it. There's no other way around, you dummy. But I need to get across. Listen what I'm telling you. There's no way! Ugly tramp.  Glob, globbit, globbit, globbit! Huh? What are you saying? "Globbit, globbit"? Who's globbit? Aah! My way!  No!  Peugghhh! Glibby-glab man, you're crazy! We're not even halfway across! You got to go back, man! It's the only way, you ugly, fat-smelling, fathead! No! My way! Aah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Uuuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Crazy! Globba, globba, globba, globba. Uh, excuse me, friend. Blblblblblblblblblblbl! Huh? You're pretty tall. Can you reach up there and get my wheel for me? Got to get these melons home to my wife. You know how it is.  My way! Watch out, Rainy! Aah! Aah! Uhp! Oof!  Rainy! Whoops. Uh Man I'm real sorry.  Yeah. No doi, friend. But I can still help. I-I'll fix your house for you. Just get out of here! Leave us alone! UhI  Psycho Fink. I was wrong Was I wrong? No Yes Yes I was wrong How could it be? I trusted in my guts but ended up all nuts I was wrong How could it be? Listened to my brain but ended up insane The melons rolled over that lady I went too far  How could it be? How did I go too far?  Yaah! Hey! I know you're here for my magical tears, but you won't have any, because I never cry. I don't want them anymore. What? Stop lying! You're here for my tears, aren't you? No. I hurt a small, hairy man's wife. I just want to go home. You're just trying to make me feel sad so you can steal my tears when I cry, but I've got a heart of stone, buddy. I'm evil! Dude! What's wrong with you?! I said I don't want your tears! You're lying! I'm not lying! You stink at lying. Ugh! Fine. Whatever, man. Have it your way. Okay I will have it my way! Huh?  Beg for mercy, or I'll kill you!  Whoa. What?  What?! I can't hear you! I said my way! Aah! Aah! Aah! Huh? Magical teardrop.  My way can still work! Yeah!  Huh? I'm okay! Yay!  Huh? Whoa! Ow! Ow, ow, ow!  Huh? Whoo-hoo!  Yeah!  Oh, yeah.  Huh?  Have you come crawling back for your proper treatment, babylips? - Yah! - Ohh!  Kiss that! Oh, my. You look horribly injured. My kisses will heal you.  Now, how does that feel? Bittersweet.  Hey, man. You want me to heal your toe with my magical goo? Ahh! No, thanks. I think the kisses work better. Excuse me! Don't stop! Keep going, please.  You're gross. Hey! We all have our own ways. You know what? You're right. 


    FINN: Are you getting all bit up by mosquitos? I don't know. I'm getting bit up by something. Man, I can't believe you said this was a good swimming hole. I said it might be good. It's not, though. - True. - Wanna just go? - Yeah. This place smells like green beans. - My name's Woobeewoo. - Oh, whoa. I need your help. My people are in trouble. I'm a Mudscamp. Yeah, Woobeewoo. Of course we'll help. Why didn't you just say something before? I'm shy. It took me a while to work up the nerve. Oh, right on. You good now? We'll see. Come. I'll take you to my village. Here we are -- the village of my people. It doesn't have an official name, but I call it "South Woobeewoo."  Uh, this way. This is the village elder. He'll fill you in on the deets. Greetings, heroes.  Bleh! Oh! Ugh! I'm so sorry about that. You know, we -- we secrete stink-oil all day out of our awful-sauce glands. You know, I guess I should have warned you. Anyway, let me cut the cheese. - Cut to the chase. - Yes. You know, I mean, of course, cut to the chase. I mean, for many -- for many moons now, our village has been under siege by the Megafrog. He's 100 stories of 110% like fresh out the grease. I mean, he cases us all up and down, from first base to home, trying to eat us alive. We -- we've always managed to escape, but it's crazy scary. I mean, w-what if you got ate? Think about it. All alone in a stomach full of acid.  "Mommy! Mommy, mommy, help me!" "Billy, is that you?" "Mommy, you sound exactly -- Mommy, you sound exactly like me! Mommy, you sound exactly like me!" "Billy, uh"  Anyway, if this keeps up, we'll have to move to the city and get jobs. We don't know how -- how to do anything cool. Look, see? The-- they're already practicing, the poor fools. They don't know what they're in for. Whoa! Relax, buddy! You're talking to the right couple of guys. Yeah, man. Me and Jake will bust this Megafrog up right up his bumblestop! That is excellent news. I mean, here, take this, please. It's not much, but -- but it's all we have. It's -- it's a bag of lollies. That's nice. Thanks, man. Now, farewell, heroes. We're counting on you -- for reals!  Hmm. Getting anything? Yeah, but it's hard to make out. Could just be some footprints or old doody. Word. Hey, I have an idea. We can use those lollipops to leave a trail. That way we won't get lost out here. Yeah, that's a great idea, man. I was just gonna throw 'em all on the ground anyway. Womp. Womp. Womp. Womp.  This way. The thing with frogs is they got a real subtle smell. It's kind of like when you open a new thing of, um, CD-Rs. Like electric celery? Yeah but subtler. Mm-hmm! Just as I suspected. Sweet. These will take us right to him.  Come on, Jake! Oh, ha ha! Heh-heh! Heh-heh! Hmm. Huh. We've passed this butt tree like three times. Oh, yeah. We should probably backtrack -- get reoriented and all that. Word. Wait, these prints are all messed up. Whoa! Yeah. Guess we better follow the lollipops back. - Where's those at? - We ran out a while ago. Sna-a-a-p. Totally lost. Dang! Do you think maybe the Megafrog made all those footprints on purpose so we'd use up all our lollies and get totally lost? What? Nah, man. Frogs are mighty dumb. You know that. He's probably running around like that 'cause he's lost.  Plus, we're not even lost. I just got to stretch up past these trees and see where we're at.  Dang! It's all misty. It's kind of nice up here, though.  Man, forget that! I can't see anything through that mess. Plus, I got struck by lightning! We're gonna have to set up camp and wait out the storm. Cool. I call fire patrol! Yeah, me, too!  Do you remember how to make a fire with sticks? Yeah, man. It's easy. Uh rub 'em together, right? Oh, yeah. I don't think it's working, man. I think I saw some guy do it like this once. That's not it. I think you're onto something, though. Yeah, here we go.  Friction! Come on, boys! Come on! Mwah! I don't know. You just gotta get some momentum going.  Ouch!  Glob-globbing stick! Glob-globbing swamp! Oh, hey, you got the fire going. Right on. - Jake, how did you -- -  What the? It's the Megafrog! Quick, put the fire out! Jake, look.  FINN: He's just sitting there. What's he doing out there? I don't know, but let's pound him while he's vulnerable. Okay, sweetles. Ow! What?  Whoa! Oh, yeah!    Wha? Jake, wake up. Look. Ow, my head hurts. Look at that thing. Oh, what?! Yeah.  Hey, whoa! That gives me a great idea! We could make a Finn and Jake out of sticks and stuff and lure the Megafrog out here then badonk him right while he's all confused.  - Yeah. That's a great idea, man. That's a great idea, Jake. Fuh, fuh-fuh. Fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh. Fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh-fuh, fuh, fuh-fuh-fuh. What? What is it, Jake? F-F-F-Fro-o-o-g! Wha?  Jake, run! Aah! Aah! Aah! Jake, stretch us out of here!  Come on, Jake!  Ow. Jake, let's hide in this cave! Hmm? Shmow town, dude! That guy's gonna dingle our bones into tapioca pudding! Finn, that is gross, man! Don't use language like that!   Chop that!   Ohh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Aah! He's eating me! Aah! Gently eating me! No teeth! Mostly tongue! Hmm? Hmm. I need your help. My people are in trouble. I'm shy. I mean, he chases us all up and down, from first base to home. We've always managed to escape. Getting anything? Yeah, but it's hard to make out. I'm shy. First base. Yeah, but it's hard to make out. - I'm shy. - It's hard to make out. Hmm. That's it! Jake, wait! Sick, dude! Huh? I know how to stop him! Nyah chow!     Aah! This is rad! I'm hot again! Thanks, little dudes! I really appreciate it. I don't get it, though. I kissed just about everything I could get my lips on. How come it only worked with you? You can't break your own curse by kissing somebody. Somebody's gotta kiss you. - Oh. Weird. Well, thanks, man. I don't know a lot of dudes who'd do that to help a guy out. Whatevs.    ICE KING: Ugh! Where the turds is my demonic wishing eye?! Ugh! I've looked everywhere! Aw!  ICE KING: What is it, girl?  ICE KING: You know where it is? Lead the way! Oh, boy, this is just wonderful! Hmm. Ah, you just want me to brush you! You know this brush is for princesses only! Ahh, princesses only -- no gunthers! What are my options here? HmmHmm, hmm. Oh! Gunther! What is your damage today?! Ooh! Wizard market! "WIZ"  Hey! You're really peeving me off, Gunther! Go stand in the corner!  I said stand in the corner. Ugh, you make me sick.  Try not to break anything while I'm gone!   Meow!  FINN: Gunther? UhJake, we gots penguins. JAKE:  Hmm, huh? Hmm? Oh, yeah. Thanks. FINN: Come on, you guys, get off me now. Wah, wah! Grah! ALL: Wah, wah, grah! FINN: Jake? JAKE: Huh?  Hey! Hyah! Now, shoo, you little creeps! Oh, this is unusual. FINN:  Glib -- dringle! JAKE:  What's with these super penguins? FINN: I don't know. I'm guessing it's the ice king. JAKE: Well, where is he then? FINN: Ice king! ICE KING: Wizards rule! Let's see. That's the symbol for magic items, right? Hey, this is the magic items shop, right? What's it look like, ya donk? ICE KING: I know that! I know! Why can't they write it on the sign, though? Why's it all got to be secret? Let's just put it all out there, huh?! Equal distribution of magic to the people! No more symbols! No more initiations! You feeling me, huntress wizard? You trying to get killed, ice king? ICE KING: Nah, I was just stepping to you, girl, with my intellectual wizard politics. No, don't go. Well, "swing at every ball," -- that's what Jay t. Dawgzone says. Hello? So then he was telling me to beef in the eye of glob and stuff. Whoa, did you do it? Heck yes, I did! Yo, I wouldn't do that. Get over it, man. Don't you want to reach the highest initiation of the secret schools? Of course, man -- "in shadow, we find the light." ALL: "Safely sealed in darkest night, so make sure y'all keep it tight, wizards only, fools." ICE KING: Keep what tight? A secret you never should have heard, ice king! ICE KING: Yo, guys, chill. I lost my demonic wishing eye. Just give me a new one, and I'll jet. I didn't hear nothing about no weird secret wizard club that I want to be a part of. Loose lips sink the ships, ice king. Sorry, man, nothing personal. ICE KING: Oh, sliz Aah! You guys, stop! Aah! JAKE:  Okay, I give up.  BOTH: Gunther? JAKE: Nice ice. FINN: What's going on here, man? Call off your super bros! JAKE: Oh, that's great! FINN: Where's the ice king, Gunther?  Gunther! What? All right. Whoa! BOTH: Wha?! FINN: Is this happening everywhere? JAKE: I don't know. Let me see. Whoop. Dang! FINN: What do you see? JAKE: Hold on. Oh, no! No! FINN: What, dude? JAKE: Hold on, man, wait. Oh, glob! This can't be happening! FINN: Tell me! JAKE: Eh, it's over. We've been conquered. FINN: Who's been conquered? JAKE: Everyone. FINN: By the ice king? JAKE: No, dude -- by Gunther. FINN: Holy shmow! Give me that! Gunther's headed for the candy kingdom! We got to save them! JAKE: Whoa! Okay! FINN: Hurry, Jake! Wait, I'm still in my pajayjays.  BUBBLEGUM: Yo, finn, are you seeing these penguins? FINN: Yeah, it's Gunther! He's taking over the whole thing! BUBBLEGUM: Well, he'll have to beat my banana guards and my gumball guardians. JAKE: That's not gonna work! BUBBLEGUM: What did he say? FINN: He says your plan is bunk. BUBBLEGUM: Well, what's your plan? FINN: I got a plan! BUBBLEGUM: You do? FINN: When we get there, I'll do my plan in addition to your plan -- two plans! Laters! BUBBLEGUM: UhAll right. So you're not gonna tell me y-- FINN: I'm outties! JAKE: You're not gonna tell her the plan? FINN: No, I got to be mysterious. JAKE: What?! I thought you weren't into bubblegum anymore. FINN: I'm not, but this is how I act now with all the ladies, you see. I keep 'em in a state of confusion. That way, I've always got options in case flame princess doesn't work out. JAKE: Oh, my gosh! Where is this coming from? FINN: It's called "future farming." I read it in that book you have by Jay t. Dawgzone. JAKE: Jay t. Daw-- aww, dude! Don't read that book! It's gonna mess up your brain! I keep that book around for laughs. It's all really bad advice. FINN: Oh, okay, I'll stop it then. JAKE: No, wellYou can still be mysterious. That's fine. FINN: What? Now I'm confused. JAKE: Never mind! I didn't say nothing. FINN: Hey, pbubs. Are you ready? BUBBLEGUM: Yes! The cavalry is standing by. FINN: Cool. I'm gonna rally some citizens and do this other plan. BUBBLEGUM: Okay, but what -- FINN: Good luck! BUBBLEGUM: Jake, what's with all the mystery? JAKE: UhOh, snap, look out! BUBBLEGUM: Banana guards, defend! BUBBLEGUM: Aw, geez! Evil presence detected! MustDefendCandyKing-- aah!  BUBBLEGUM: You'll never get past these walls! I think!   FINN: This is my plan! I got the candy kingdom underground to help me collect all the bottles in the land!  JAKE: Breaking news -- that mystery plan of yours is a smash hit!  BecauseOf the glass. I guess all they care about is bottles, huh? BUBBLEGUM: But what'll happen when they run out of bottles? FINN: I won't let that happen, prubbs.  FINN: Stay back!  BUBBLEGUM: Wait a minute! Put away your weapons, and we'll get you more bottles! FINN: Peeb, there aren't any bottles left. BUBBLEGUM: I have a third plan. JAKE: SoWe make them new bottles, then the gunthers break the bottles, and then we pick up the glass and make new bottles again? BUBBLEGUM: Yep. FINN: What, like, forever? BUBBLEGUM: Yes. FINN: Bubb, your planBunks. BUBBLEGUM:  Yeah. JAKE: I like it. I got a rhythm going! Dink-dink, da-dink-dink, tink-tink-ta-tink, ta-ta-tink, ta-da-da-dink, dink-tink, tink-ta-tink, ta-ta-tink-tink, dink-da-da-dink, da-da-da-da-da, da-dink!  BUBBLEGUM: What? What do you want? I don't -- FINN: He wants to smash the gumball guardian's head! BUBBLEGUM: We're going to make more bottles. Just wait, okay?  ALL: No!! Goodbye, princess. No.  ICE KING: Hey! What's going on here? Why's this place all crazy? I was just flying by and --  Gunther! You took my stuff!  ICE KING: That's bad! You know what you get now?  ICE KING: That's right! You get the squirty-squirts. Bad! Bad! Now take off my demonic wishing eye! All right, Gunther, now go home!  ICE KING: That's right! Walk! While you're walking home you think about what you did!  It's getting worse and worse with him. He just -- he hates it when I leave the castle. I'm sorry, guys. JAKE: Uh, dude, where have you been?! FINN: Yeah, and why are you all jacked-up? ICE KING:  Well, I got into some crazy wiz-biz over at wizard city. Honestly, I don't even know how I survived. Basically, it was the craziest showdown ever. I -- I wish I could tell you all about it, but, you know, "wizards only, fools -- keep it tight."  


     The goblins have suffered long enough, Xergiok! Shush! You guys can't live without me, right? BOTH: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow! You got problems, man. Bah!   Wands are for wimps!

Congratulations. Oh!  W-we need a good King to rule us, like you, mayhaps? Oh, yeah! You should do it! Yeah, be their King. No, man. I'm an Adventurer fo' life. If there isn't a King to tell me not to start a riot, I-I could start a riot, then. No rules, baby! Start that riot!  Riot! Flip this table! No one can tell me no!  Aah! Please, Finn. We need a King!  Stop the riot!  I'll become your King to save y'all from yourselves. We have a new King!  Hey, Finn's gonna need a Queen. I'll do it.  Allow me to show you the grounds, your Majesties. Show me what we got, Gummy. Show it to me! Dude, I'm psyched!  Yeah. The Goblin Birthing Pits, your majesties. I'm being born! That's pretty neat. The Garden of Living Fountains. Whoo! Awesome! The Royal Game Archive, complete with controller hats. BOTH: Ooh! The Royal Dragon Stables. Oh!  Whoa. And, finally, the royal bedroom, with king-sized bed for the royal couple. Could you make that a bunk bed? Yes, my Queen. Whisper Dan! I call the top! And I call -- GUMMY: Wait! For you, great King, the book of royal rules. Mm. Sounds boring. Oh, no worries, my Liege. I'll read it to you. Hey, Jake. You want to stay awake and hear some rules?  All right, lay it on me, Gummy. "Introduction, colon, the 623 royal rules were established in Moon Year 16, in response to elder Gorflox's repeated request for an organized response" GUMMY: Awaken, your highness! No way, dude.  Your Excellency, let's go. We have much to do. Whoo! This is where you may perform your daily processes, my King. Whoa! Look at that huge mirror! And it's painted baby blue -- boys style! Come, Sire. It is time to brush your teeth in front of the "boys style" mirror. Whoo! Awesome! BOTH:  Oh, no, no, no, your majesty! Please! Let us brush your teeth! Kyah! Whoa, ease up, dudes. Finn access only. Aah! He's a rule breaker! Don't spank us too hard! Spare them, your majesty! Spank me instead! Set my buttocks ablaze! Guys, what are you talking about? Rule one, "the King shall not brush his own teeth," in the book of royal rules I read to you last night. Oh! Oh. Guys, put your hams away. ALL: Wha?! I'm not gonna spank your hams. I'm not that kind of King. So, then, we may brush your teeth, my Lord? You can brush my teeth I guess. ALL: Yay! Oh. This brunch looks great. Can't wait to dig in. Uh, I will out that, your highness. Gummy, as King, I order you to let me out it. I'm sorry, Sire. The royal rules don't allow it. I'm cutting it, Gummy! No! Thank you, Gummy. Uh, a thousand pardons, my Lord. You're not going to chew that, are you? Yeah. I'm sorry, Sire. The royal rules don't allow it. Gummy, just let me do this. No one will know. I would know. Uh, Jake, this is nuts. Maybe, but rules are rules.  GUMMY: Master, eat your food. I chewed it thoroughly and heated it to goblin body temperature. I'm not hungry, Gummy. You look a little bit down. Would you like me to weep for you? No, Gummy. It's just --  GOBLIN: Sire! Sire! There's trouble in Town Square! A thief! A thief?  Yes! I'll handle it! No, sire! The King is not allowed to fight. He must give a speech to the thief. That is the royal rule, my Liege. There's the thief! Give me them hot buns, Lady! Hey, thief!  I got a speech for yo-- no! The royal speaker must give the speech. What?! You see?  Since the dawn of time, the balance of what is right and what is wrong has come into question  I'll take this. Yes, you can feel it slowly working, eh? LADY: Oh, no! Aah! I can't let this go on! Gimme! Hands off, thief!  Ha! Here you go, old lady. Oh, no! The new King! Just as cruel as the last King. Hi -- Yo. . .what? Oh, King, we beg you not to slay the old lady. ALL: Don't hurt us! No, wait! Don't slay me! You may keep the hot buns, your majesty! I'm ready for my spanking, Mr. Xergiok part two. ALL: We're ready for our spanking, Sire! I just want to help y'all as much as I can And y'all just keep showing me your goblin hams When I became King I didn't think y'all would show me your rears But I'll accept my boring fate and shed this tear 'Cause I can't seem to cure you of your groundless fears  No! No more spankings!  Aah! Gummy, don't be afraid. I'm gonna stick to the rules now, okay? My Lord, I'm sorry, y-you haven't heard? Xergiok is returning with an evil army! Come look -- through the scope. You see?  Prepare to destroy them all! Oh!  If I defeat Xergiok as King, I can prove to the goblins that an active King can be a good King. But I can't let them know until it's all over. Stay fainted, Gummy. Oh! Whisper Dan, have you seen Jake?  JAKE: I'm in here. Xergiok's back with an army of earclopses. Let's bust them up!  All right, man. How do we do this? Hmm. What if they figure it out? No way, man. I'm going to be honest with you, King Finn. When I'm scared, I feel most safe in your lap. Line up for your spankings, Goblins! Oh! Too late -- in my pants! Jake, the goblins can't see me being un-Kingly. I need a disguise. Jump in my mouth!  Yah! Who among you has the courage to face Xergiok?! Shut your kissing hole, Xergiok! It's time for a beating! I salute you, foolish warrior! You can be my personal sla--  Whoa! Whoa! Wow-wow-wow-wow- wow-wow-wow! How in the world?! Dude, no one uses earclopses in battle without earplugs. Eat this!  Pow! Pow! Pow! Whoa! Ha ha! You missed me!  Oh, great King. With the help of a brave soldier, you thwarted the evil Xergiok. Huzzah!  Come on, dude. Let's get out of here. JAKE:  Aww. All right. Well, looks like they got the King they wanted, buddy. JAKE: Yup. And we're going home to adventure. JAKE: Mm-hmm. High five us, dude. Hey, Jake? JAKE: What? FINN: Why do the insides of you smell like vanilla? JAKE: Oh. A wizard put a curse on me. FINN: Huh. Neat.  


    The other one. Hmm? Uhhhhhhhhh JAKE: Finn? Finn? Sorry. Finn, I'm bored. Are you sure Princess Bubblegum doesn't like me anymore? Yeah, that's what she said. Sounds weird. Are you lying so you can do this dinner thing alone with Bubblegum? No way. I don't know if this is a good idea after your breakup with Flame Princess. P.B. ls out of your age range, anyway. No way, man, I got no ex-pec-tates. Whatever happens happens. Hey. Finn! Let's go. Lates, bro. Comm! Hey-hey, things got fancy 'round here.  Hee-yolp! Thanks again for coming to castle Lemongrab with me, Finn. I kind of hate these diplomatic dinners. Also, I think the Lemongrabs are getting weirder. Oh, uh, you know me -- Pretty good with weird stuff. It's just a shame that Jake didn't want to come. I love Jake! Mm, yeah. We all love Jake.  Abnouncing arrival 0' Princest Bubbuhguhh an' little boy!  Mm, Princess!  BOTH: - Holy - Uh So pleased and gracious to welcome you to our sophisticated society.  Bow! Yes, welcome -- N-o-o-o! Do it no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-w! I-I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-t's dinnertime!  Mee mee mee, mee mee mee mee. Mee? Mee mee Yo, Peebs, how's your lemon? Finn, this is mega-weird. Something's happened to the two Lemongrabs. They used to be exactly the same. No! You're floating too high! Unh! It's time for the floor show! Hey, Princess, look who happens to carry a flute with him. No! Lemons only! Floor sho-o-o-o-o-o-w!  Do it better. Mm.  Mmm! Wh-a-a-a-a-a-a-at?! Unacceptab-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-le! Mm. Acceptable. Wh-a-a-a-a-a-a-at?! Unacceptab-l-l-le! Acceptable Unacceptable! Ugh. I can't watch this any more. Excuse me, Finn. Okay. Let me know if you get lonely. Unacceptable! Man, this place is falling apart. Huh?  Poor little Lemonhope Sweet little Lemonhope Stuck in this bathroom  Thrown in the garbage Dunked in the pudding Dipped in the porridge  U n kakaaa- Huh?!  Poor little Lemonhope Throw me a lemonrope ls there a home for me and my harp? A place where friends give me hugs?  There's no use to mope There's no use to hope No use at all for  I' Fragile, precious, darling, baby, poor little Lemonhope Jâ Oh, hi. What's your name, little boy? My name is Badlemon Nohope, but you can call me Lemonhope.  N-o-o-o-o-o-o! Nyah! That noise! That ugly lemon and his ugly noise! Hey! By all accounts, this is a brilliant and sensitive little boy! Thank you, mistress. I'm taking Lemonhope back to the Candy Kingdom and enrolling him in a school for gifted children. No. He needs to stay here! Ohh! I hope you will still be joining us for dessert. We need to free that darling boy. Maybe there's something in the Candy Kingdom/ Lemon-Earldom treaty, but I don't think there is. What about a prank? Finn, what are you talking about? Mm, I don't know. Maybe if we prank Lemongrab, like, just right, they'll let us take that guy home? Yeah, prank. I don't see how that's going to help us at all. Pranks? Like old times. Finn, no. That's really -- Hmm. Okay, yeah. We'll pull a prank. Like old times. O-kay! Puddin'. Bakin' soder. Vina-gurt. Andthe bait. Now, when Lemongrab stirs his puhd -- pff-chuu! 'Splode-cano.  Pretty smart, dude. Hey. Ahh! My mum. Going to enjoy this puhd. Oh, really looking forward to this puhd. Mm. Oh! Wh-wh-what is this? Ha ha! Now give us back Lemonhope or prepare for mo' pranks! Dungeon!  Guess I must admit -- one would have a hard time claiming that to have been a Pretty good plan. Sorry, P.B. No, no, your plan was great, Finn. See? What's this? Huh? Your flute. Wow! Now Lemonhope can play it, and the Lemongrabs will come open the door to smash the flute, and we can all escape! Really great work, Finn. Oh. Here, Lemonhope. Now, will you play something for us? Something beautiful? Yes, mistress. Let me help you with -- Lemonhope! I was sharp at the harp. Now it's my turn to learn the flute to boot!  Yeeeeeee!  -  - Oh, yes. Oh, mm. Oh, my. Oh, yes.  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whee!  Come one and all and join the dance!  How dare you?! How dare you release my prisoners?! You're soft, Lemongrab! Softer than an old graham cracker! You're s-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oft!  Yipe!  Oh, no! We're locked in! Finn, give me your phone! I'm calling Jake! What? No. Let's, um We could do another prank! I brought some of your superspicy hot sauce. Ah, so spice! Finn, this is serious! Butmy other plan worked. Finn, your other plan failed, which was part of my plan, which worked. Your plan? But I thought we were having fun together. Finn, I have citizens who need me! I can't always treat everything like a little-boy game. Oh. Yeah. No, that's cool. Mistress! Mistress, look! Something scary is happening now!  How dare you?! After all I've done for you! You try to steal my Lemonhope away! You're too old, Princess! Too old for pranks! Too old! I've tried imprisoning! I've tried reconditioning! You leave me no choice. Lemongentr-y-y-y-y-y! Go forth!  Go forth now! ALL: Sorry! Sorry, sir! Get to safety, Princess. I'll hold them off. What? Sorry, sir! Sorry! I'm sorry, sir. Sorry. Wait. So, do you not like any games or just little-boy games? Finn  Lemonbrothers, stop! Stop and listen! It has cost me much, but I have learned Lemon need not squeeze Lemon to survive! Lemonhope, go forth! Grow strong and return for us! Go! TOGETHER: Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! You're going to love the Candy Kingdom, Lemonhope. You'll learn all about playing and play math and learning all day long. And you'll never get yelled at. Unless you drink my soda from out the fridge. LEMONHOPE: Yes, mistress. Yo, man. How's it going? Terrible? Well, yeah, mostly. But I think I learned something. Goon Well, I'm thinkin' maybe age is isn't just a number. Maybe older people, like, really are different. You know? Like, less fun inside. So what you sayin' here? I'm saying, I think I really sbonked up. I got to patch things up with Flame Princess. Oh. dang! Didn't you hear? She's got a new boyfriend already! What?!  Man, I'm just kiddin'.  Oh, yeah.  She might, though.    This party is so crazy!


  Hey, man. Oh, hey, Finn! So you got my map? Ha, yeah. So, how's your experiment going? Ah, it's going great. I really feel like I fit in so to speak. So are you ready to come home? Nah, I think I'm just gonna keep being a brick for a while. Mmmmm what are you doing again? Finn, ever since I was little, I wanted to see what it's like to be a brick in a brick shack when the brick shack falls down. And this shack is gonna fall down. Just look at it. Like sand castles in the sun, baby. You're too young. You wouldn't understand. You're right. I don't understand. But I'm cool with your mystical journey or whatever. I'm gonna leave this walkie-talkie so we can stay in touch, just in case. What?! No, man, bricks don't stay in touch! Dude, Beemo is, like, really worried about you. Aww you tell that little goofball I said hi. I will. Welp, I guess I should head back. Oh really? So soon? Yeah, well, it took me like half the day to get here. Besides, you're just a brick, right? Yeah. All right, see ya, Jake! Bye! Okay, back to being a brick. I'm so bored. Pb-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-ht! Ooh, I'm starting to get a little tippy in my teacups. A bunny! Looks like our long-eared friend is onto something. Bunnies love to dig. He's making a supreme effort, and I think I can guess why. That's right a carrot growing out here free and wild. Probably the result of a stray seed pooped out by a passing bird. But what's this? A mysterious rustling in the bush. Could mean trouble. Mr. Bunny seems to think so. His sensitive whiskers quiver at the hint of imminent danger. Unfortunately for Mr. Bunny, this is what nature is all about. It's a male deer. Not a threat to Mr. Bunny, in the predatory sense, but still above him in the food chain. Mr. Bunny, wishing to avoid an encounter, hops away to safety. Wow. Deers are jerks. Hey, man, you know I can hear everything you say, right? What?! Ohh! No! I had no idea! Yeah, but you saw me leave the walkie-talkie. And I left it on. You know that, right? - Hi, Jake! - Hi, Beemo. You need anything? A soda? No. So, what's Mr. Bunny doin' now? It's not about the bunny! The bunny is incidental to the brick experiment! - Oh. Sorry, man. - Forget about the bunny. - Sorry, man. - Sorry, Jake. Look, we'll, uh we'll leave you alone. Finn, are you still there? Finn? Beemo? Mr. Bunny retreats to his warren, its homemade comforts some consolation to help pass the hungry night. Twilight falls on the peaceful forest, a twilight unaware of the struggles it both soothes and conceals. The crickets begin to stir, rehearsing their musical rhapsodies. In the distance, flashes of heat lightning illuminate a purple summer sky. Even angry deer, at last, must come to rest. And so it is with our erstwhile antagonist, who has disappeared into a stand of trees, perhaps to dream of tomorrow's pointless battles. Oh, my glob! It's a crazy storm! This might be it! This weather might knock the whole thing down! If a definition of bravery exists, this must be it a lone bunny, facing off against the elements ineffectually pushing around some twigs with his pink bunny nose a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but sometimes that's all we have. The wind is beginning to pick up, and it's becoming clear that mother nature has not just knocked on the door. She has come in, sat down, and poured herself a drink. Mr. Bunny has no friends, no family, no loved ones of any kind. The wind is really picking up now  small puddles gathering around the entrance to Mr. Bunny's cozy home beginning to grow in size and connect with one another. It won't be long now. But what's this? Looks like this unflagging little hero of a bunny will have some help, though. A family of friendly beavers appears to have taken up the cause. Often called "nature's architects," these intrepid mammals are sparing no effort to shore up the endangered burrow. Here's an unusual sight. It's a sea lard! You'd expect to see a few mudscamps out in weather like this, but here we have a rare treat, indeed. This little beauty is pretty far outside of her natural habitat. But I've heard it said by wise old salts schooled in ancient maritime lore that a storm will sometimes blow them off course to a remarkable degree. Looks like we've got some pretty good evidence tonight. Yes, sir, sometimes those old sailors know what they're talking about. It's the triumph of experience versus the secondhand verities of musty academic tomes. This feisty sea lard is pitching right in to save the rabbit hole, belying its slothful reputation. She uses her prodigious, swiveling behind to increase the size of the hole while the beavers continue to reinforce the sides with straw and stick. At times like these, the supposed cruelty and indifference of the natural world all too often its most salient feature pale before the nobler instincts of even our most humble kin. In the morning light, few signs remain of the summer storm that battered this idyllic glen. The beavers are finished with their work and are heading home. The sea lard looks like she's gonna wander the woods for a while. Maybe she'll find her way back to the ocean and write a novel about her experiences. Mr. Bunny is exhausted, but can rest easy knowing that his home is secure. But, alas, the bunny's rest is short-lived. The deer is back. The deer, perhaps confused by the antlerlike appearance of Mr. Bunny's protective dam, is now testing the situation. Mr. Bunny is unsure of where this is going. And with a single smash from the deer's powerful front hooves, the bunny's home is under attack! Mr. Bunny has hopped to safety and can only watch as the deer continues its relentless rampage on the only home he knows. A couple of more mighty smashes, and the dam The dam has been breached! Water is now flooding in! The deer continues its attack! This deer's misplaced rage, combined with its size and weight, is more than enough to bring down the weakened walls, which are now starting to give, aided by the unforgiving weight from the tree above. Even Mr. Deer, in his blind fury, seems to sense what's about to happen, as he steps to one side. It's over. The warren has been destroyed an injustice of astronomical levels. Words fail me. Actually, he doesn't seem that upset. He's on his feet, checking out his new surroundings. Even the deer is impressed. As if confused by the events, he performs a comical double-take and retreats into the forest. Ladies and gentlemen, this bunny is indomitable! Yay! This bunny has the right attitude. Who cares about being a brick in a wall of a falling-down shack? There's something bigger than that, and the bunny has answers! Teach me, Mr. B! Uh! Aww Jake? Jake? You there, buddy? Over. - Hey, Finn. Hey, man. You ready to come home? That sounds good. Awesome. See you soon. Yessss!    This party is so crazy!


    Gary: Hey, Johnny. Look at this. It's the notorious poop gang making a big mess all over our five-way intersection. Your five-way intersection? This is our five-way intersection. No, no. It's theirs. Ours is, like, way over there. Well, if they want it, they can take it. You hear that, boys? Fire us up, Hugo. Uh Yeah, well, whatever, marshmallow kids. Okay, you guys, let's get this over to the orphanage for their charity jam sale. Bless you, marshmallow kids. Always keeping the bad elements at bay. Hey, Tommy, is it okay if me and the boys set up a small card table outside the tavern? We're thinking about playing some games. Games? I like games.  Sure, Tommy. Who doesn't?   That one. You win again! - Yeah! - Yeah, all right! - Hmm? - This guy just won five times in a row! Johnny: Huh. Quickest Golly. Okay, same as before. Let's do it some more. The way to make money is to point - To the shell with the pea. - Gee. Huh! I know! How much can I wager? As much as you've got. And they laugh at me for carrying my life savings in my pocket That one. Ooh! There we go. Banana Guards, move out! Let's roll.  Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee Where'd they go? Jake! They're in tunnel four!  Yeah! Banana Guards ain't never gonna get us. End of the line, marshmallow kids. - Aw! - Aw! Okay, Jake. Scare 'em straight. Jake: That's right. I used to be like you kids Making 20 bucks a day, feeling like a king. Uh, we make Wow. That's a lot. Okay, Jake. Why don't you take off? I think I got this. Wow. 500 bucks. Wow. Sorry, guys, but I got to take y'all in for baby booking. - Aw, man! Not again! - Oh! Come on! Eh, forget it, fellas. Finn doesn't know what it's like to grow up on the streets. He lives in a tree. - Whoa! - No way! We've never even seen a tree. That can't be true. There's a tree right over there. That's a tree? It's beautiful! Us street kids sure are learning a lot from you. More than we'd ever learn from baby booking, that's for sure. Hmm. Hey, Peebs, I think all these scamps need is a nature walk. Sounds good, Finn. I trust you. Gary: Ha ha! All right! You hear that, gang? Finn's taking us out of the city! - Yay! - Yeah, yay!  Look at all these bugs. Just like in my Mom's kitchen. Look at me! I'm a rock climber! I'm flying! If you guys think this biz is cool, check out this other biz. See this fallen tree? Jake and I laid it over this river last summer, and we call it "shortcut bridge." Check it. - Wow! - Ooh! - So cool! - Wow! Pretty cool, huh? Now you guys! Okay! Yeah! That's it, Gary! Guys, cheer him on! Yay! Together:  Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary, be careful! - Gary! - Gary! Thanks for pulling me out of that water street, Finn. It's called a river, Gary. A river. Boy, wait till I tell the fellas. Hey, fellas. What are you doing there? Trying to build a Aw, what?! I went out on a limb for you guys. What's a limb? A limb is like a branch on a  This guy. How'd we do, boys? We made about 42 nuts.  Holy cats. These forest folks are some grade-a rubes. Easy pickings, I tell you. Sucker city! Finn: Hey, you guys tricked me.  Hey, wait!  Hey, Finn, just wanted to see how the nature walk is going. Uh You know, those marshmallow kids remind me of you when you were a young lad. Uh I'm glad you're helping them get on the right path. - Thanks. -Okay, got to run. I'll assume everything's great because if it wasn't, you would have said something. Bye. You lied to her. You're worse than us. No, you guys. He's better than us. - Huh? - Huh? He just pulled one over on the princess. But he's a dope! Nah. Don't you get it? He's just pretending to be a dope, but deep down, he's a grifter like us. What? See? Look at him right now. He's all, "who me?" Ha. We could learn a lot from him. Teach us everything you know, Finn. I guess that works. We have to keep warm in the woods, so we're gonna build a fire. So, you take a minimum of two sticks, and you rub them together. - Huh? - Huh? Um, okay. You need to scam a couple of sticks. You can usually spot your average dimwitted sticks around these tree dummies. You trick them into a bundle like so. You grab two marks and defraud them into rubbing together. You flimflam your breath onto the sticks.  You bamboozle these flaming idiot sticks onto the other marks. And all of them will catch on fire Like a bunch of suckers. - Whoa! - Whoa! These sticks are stone-cold dopes. Looks like the clouds are gonna drop a dime on us. So I'll show youse guys how to build a shelter. - Build? - Build? Yeah. You can always scam nature into being a shelter. You find a couple more branch rubes. You mislead the longest branch to lay horizontal between two blockhead trees. Then you double-cross some leafy boughs into leaning against each other. Bam! You got a roof.  You like how I did that? You got to be real conniving. Stick with me, boys. I'll teach you all the forest hustles. When you get hungry, you sneak up to a "boosh," and wham! You hoax the berries. Heh! Food for nothing! These bushes are some easy marks, fellas. - Good thing we scammed a fire. - Yeah. This open air would have hoodwinked our body temperature. Toss me some of those sweet bloobies, Gary. - Hup! -  I got to get a picture of this. Wish I had a camera. I'll just try to remember it good. And Perfect. Caramel quicksand! Mallow kids, help! I'm sinking! Say, what kind of scam is this? Aah! It's no scam! I'm really sinking! Oh, wait. Do you want us to scam the quicksand? Throw me, uh Scam me a rope! You fellas see any fancy ropes around here? Hey, you! Vine! Whoops. Hey, I barely touched him. Heck, I know I'd rather be a rope than a boring old vine. Gary: Yeah, you want to be a dumb plant your whole life? I'm sinking, dagnabit! How are we gonna scam this vine into being thrown over to Finn? Just yank it down!  Yank it down? What does that mean? Hey, fellas, you know what always works? - Pea, pea. Where's the pea? - Gee. I don't like the looks of this. We have to go old school. - No way, man. - No way, man. We promised ourselves never to go old school unless things got serious. Things have gotten serious. Maybe this vine needs a sandwich packed with a slap! How does my slap sandwich taste? You're a rope from now on, see?  - You want some more? - How does this feel? You need some more of this?  Aw, geez. We killed him.  - Yay! - Yay! Together:  Finn! Finn! Finn! Thanks, marshmallow kids. I thought I was going to sink forever. But we failed your test, Mr. Finn. We couldn't scam this guy into being a rope. We had to resort to low violence. Together: We ain't worthy to be your students. You can't use scams to save somebody from quicksand. You kids weren't scamming sticks or branches or anything. You've been camping the whole time.  - No scam?! - No scam?! Wow. You scammed us into thinking we were scamming. You scammed us good. You're our hero. Nothing was a scam.  Yeah, right. No scam! No scam!  I give up.  So, Finn, how are the marshmallow kids doing? Eh?  Fellas! I'm scamming these numbers into subtracting themselves from each other. Ha ha. Suckers. We're scamming this globe into teaching us about geography. I had to get kind of rough with this book, but now it's putting thoughts into my head For nothing! You did a wonderful job, Finn. Now all we need to do is worry about him. Same as before. Let's do it some more. Finn: Jake. Uh These gentlemen dropped their shells. Heh. Gah-ooh


  No. Mnh. Okay, okay. I'm up. Ahh! Hey, everybody. I've asked you here today because you are the best of the best. Anyway, recent data shows an increased chance of threat to the Candy Kingdom. So I'm developing a new defense. I've installed sleeping gas in the Gumball Guardians. If any bum tries to attack us, they will be sprayed without mercy. Isn't that nice? The only thing is, the gas will spread and knock out anyone who breathes it anyone but you guys, my trained elite. So watch closely. I'm gonna show you all how to overcome the gas with sheer willpower. Hit it! Now, make a fist with your brain and punch against sleepy times saying, "No! Nooo! Noooooo!" Don't go ungentle into that good night. Hi! Yo, Bubblegum. Marceline, you're up late. No time for chit-chat. Let's hang out right now. Hmm. I don't know. I'm, uh, kind of busy. Uh, hi. Listen, Bub-Bubs, I tracked down Maja the Sky Witch. Oh. What? Yeah, I tailed her to an enchanted forest, but it's all jammed up with barrier spells. Ohh, I think I see where this is going. Well, you love getting out your big brain, and and I just thought it'd be cool to spend some quality time with you. I need your help, okay? But why are you so interested in finding Maja? It's just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really important to me. Whoa. Okay. But Come on! I got your pack pack. Um, sure, but Hold on to that "but," PB. Whee! Whee! Huh! Something's wrong. Huh? Hey! This stuff, it's like a brick wall. Let's just blow the whole thing up. Hmm. It's a sleeping gate bramble. How do we kill it? All we have to do is take the path of least resistance. All right. So, where is it the path? It's in here and in here. Now Take a deep breath And be passive. Hello, friend. Trouble relaxing? How 'bout a cup of chamomile tea? Wow! Wild digs. Tell me about it. My googoomama meter is going babies. And look at my watch. It's pink. It's running backwards. There's serious witchery afoot here. Come on, Princess. We don't got all night. What are those things? Totem cairns. That's Maja's crabbit familiar. Hooba-wha? Marceline! It's me! Hambo! Yeah, girl. What took you so long? I thought you gave up on me. Your teddy bear? - I'm sorry, man. - Yo, wait a sec. What?! Marcy, how old are you? It's a trick, right? Come on! Help me out, dum-dum. Ah-boo-hoo. Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo. Get off. Buddy! No! Aah! Bonnie! You killed him? Don't be dense. Hambo can't even talk. Snap out of it, girl. He's been with a witch this whole time. Maybe he can talk now. That's seriously what this is about rescuing your old teddy bear? Yeah. Sorry I didn't tell you. You might not have come otherwise. Um, yeah. Raggedy Princess can make you a new Hambo in like three seconds. Or Raggedy Princess can be your new Hambo, She'd do it, too. That girl's got like zero self-respect. That's mean. Don't tell her I said that. I'm not getting a new Hambo. There's only one Hambo. - It's just a doll. - See this? Vhoooooooooooo. What's that? You gonna bop me one? It's coming in for a landing. What you gonna do, PB? Want to keep dissing Hambo? I'm sorry, Marceline. Let's go get Hambo. Disengage. We should track that bird-rabbit thing. Right. Hmm. Bang. There goes some broken branches. - It left a trail. - I see it. Hey! Hold on, now! This bag's mad heavy! Glommit! Ugh! Marceline! I thought you needed my help. Huh. Nice trick, Maja. You in there, Marceline? Hyah! Wh-o-o-o-oa! Ugh! Oof! Okay, PB, use your brain. Where would this witch keep Hambo? Break it down. Micro and macro the picture becomes clear. A-A-A-A-nd Call it. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Wait. Yes. Where are you, Maja, you creep? Oof! What? Hambo! No! You again. I'll kill you! Give me Ham ugh! Geez, man. This must be all of her stolen junk. Ugh. What a creep. Psht. A Ford Bronchus. Hmm. Whoa! "My privates"? Come here, biddy. Bam. Whoops! Pbht! What the Invoices? Receipts? "Zumma zoom bleep blop for the purchase of Hambo." Whoa. What? That's my private box! Maja's mitts only, you goof. So, you purchased Hambo from some weenus named Ash? That's right. He was a weenus, so I wrote it on there as my personal joke. But the sale is still legit. Hambo's mine. His body's all juice-logged with sentimental affection, a savory spell spice. So get out of my face, all right? Where's Marceline? She's busy with my crabbit crowbit crow rabbit. I knew that tranch wouldn't respect my proof of purchase. So, what about you, bozo? By the laws of my kingdom, I must honor the exchange of goods for legal tender, but guess what I'm not leaving without Hambo. So what are you gonna do about it? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. Marceline! Yoink! Hambo! Oh, it's me, buddy. How did you I took care of it. Let's bust out. They got away with your  Hambo. Huh, duh. I let them. You what? I made a trade for this. Bing! Mmm! Sentimental freshness! Oh, the psychic resonance on Hambo is nothing compared to this baby! Whoo! Listen, Maja. I am not your familiar anymore. I want to be a dancer. That's cool. Then why don't you dance to this?! Aaaah! Nice moves. Now you're the weenus! Hey, don't go! Aah! I'm cooking up something big, crabbit. This is my victory lap!    - This party is so crazy!


Unacceptable. Mm Un-unacceptable. Unaccepta Aaah! Lemons! Whew! Gunter? Y-you having a bad dream? Gunter? Oh, my glob. Hello, Simon. Aaaaah Oh, Lady! Hi. Wait, you don't remember me? Oh, man. I'm so sorry. I stalk a lot of ladies. Were you at Shelby's barbecue? Huh. Looks like you've lost it all the way. You've crossed the Valley of Tears and come out the other side but a shadow. Oh, thanks. Well, all the better for you to submit. I like where this is going. Don't resist. Sell your spirit to the skies. Surrender to The Empress Eyes. Empress, my darling! My great eternal love! How can I serve you? Bring me blood. At once! Alley-oop! Oh, oh, this is so sad. Here you go, my love. What's this? Don't you have any human? Humans? Well, Finn's the only human around here. Try a penguin. Wenk! Ugh. You know, Empress is a kind of penguin, and your name is Empress. That's kind of cool, right? Bleh. Tastes like cheese water. Where's the top-drawer stuff? Oh, uh, don't be like that, honey-poo. I'll fix it. I'll do anything for you. Bring me the blood of Finn! Okay. Oh, look. I've gotten to my bit. "Today I met a super-pretty cyclops lady with fangs. She told me to eat a fat boulder, and I did it." Ha! I'd forgotten that one. The Empress!  Vampiyah, I'm gonna kick yah Vampiyah, I'm gonna lick yah Vampiyah  Aah! Uh-oh. It's P.B.'s outside clock! Ahh. You did a tremendous job guarding the cabin, Jake. But it looks like you need to be relieved. Yeah, I need relief. P.B. still working on new vampire-busting gear? Yeah, but she's almost done. No sign of Marceline, though. I think she ditched us to fight the vampires by herself. Solo-style. We'll go look for her after P.B.'s device is up and running. So, how did you pass the time? Patted my laps and made some rhymes.  Stoop, stoop, sittin' on the stoop Stoop, stoop, sittin' on the stoop  Is that P.B.'s outside clock? Looks like it's been staked. - What did you do? I heard a loud snap, and my vampire-hunting reflexes kicked in! Dude, that was her Uncle Gumbald's outside clock. Yeeegh! She doesn't have to know I broke the clock. Let's blame it on the vampires! Or we can hide it! Whoo! Problem solved? Yeah? Whooop! Snap! Aaah! What was that?! Vampiyah! Aah! Aah! Hyah! Hah!  Snap, snap, snapping branches for fun  Oh, ho, ho, this is riveting. "The Empress is so nice. Today she let me polish her boots with my tongue. That's almost like kissing, right?" Hey! Who's my hunny bunny?! Simon! Marceline! What has she done to you? Did she bite you?! Hey, calm down. You're destroying the mood. I'm trying to get her to bite me later. Minion! Honestly, I'm standing right here as you collude against me with my sworn enemy. It's a bit rude. - Sorry. - Eh! Stake! - Yeah! - Finn? I got your back, Marceline! Ha! Huh? Ow. How dare you stake my back? I was aiming for your heart! Ice King, bind the interlopers in ice. Heh. Let's keep it down, huh? My baby's resting. Aaaaaah! No way! Waaaaaaah! Shush! Simon, you have to resist the Empress! But she's a woman. Aha! Ohh. She's a vampire! I hunt vampires because of you! Because of me?  How my life was without you I thought my life was through I could barely stay on my feet and I couldn't find much to eat Every so often, I'd make a sad tone Because I felt so, so alone I missed you by my side I was so lost without you as my guide Then one day, I thought I saw you from far away But it wasn't you when he turned around to say Hello to the little girl running up to him Also to his wife The day was getting dim I wanted to get close, and to talk to the couple Then I saw a vampire about to cause them trouble I destroyed the vampire enemy, but I'd scared away the family Mem-mem-memories Mem-mem-mem memories Mem-mem-mem-mem memories  Staking vampires, protecting the last remaining humans, it felt like I was protecting you. It was the only thing that brought me happiness during those years. Oh, Marceline! Simon? A-are you remembering? Pa-chazz! Shmowzow. Please, Simon! Remember our history! Our what now? Oh, Marceline. I heard everything. I was invisible. All your tiresome mortal emotions, they'll all be over soon. Minion, I order you to kill Marceline. Whaaa?? No way! She's my pal! Are you disobeying me? Hey, it's called real talking. and you still can't get anything right, can you? Here's our chance! Please, baby, don't say that. You're my thrall. - I am enthralled by you! - You distract the Empress. Squeeze! Yaaaah! Ha! No! Heuk! Drat. Aaaaaaaah! You got this comin'. No! Simon, what are you doing? Let me go! If you want to hurt my lady, you'll have to go through me! Uuuuuugh! Now, Oaf! Kill her! Sweetie, there's no need to raise your voice. What?! Okay, that's it. Turn and look at me. Oh! Are we gonna gaze into each other's eyes again? You must fall deeper under my spell. Sell your spirit to the skies. I can see myself in your pupils. Hee-hee. You're not even hypnotized. At all. Them gigantic sparkly orbs of yours could hypnotize an earclops. So, you're not. Eh-heh, no. B-but honey, wh-why you being so mean to me? Because you're too thick to even fall under my spell. And you got no class. Oh, so you're doing that? You're gonna start name-calling? You want to play the blame game?! Okay! Well, if you weren't so perfect and and pretty and statuesque and and Come on, Simon. It's over. It's gonna be okay, man. Nope, nope. This way. This way. Come on, let's get you some ice cream. That's the last time you're gonna toy with his heart. Psht! If you really cared about him, why'd you let him degenerate into this pathetic clown character? He used to have more of a silver-fox thing going on, with his hair and those cute glasses. He was happier then, you know. When he was serving me. Aaaaaaah! Dang, girl. Aaah! Aaah! Aah! Gah! Open those peepers! Eat a stake! Huhn No! Ugh! I don't understand this. Marceline! Yeah, you're welcome! Hunh Um Marceline? All right. I shouldn't have tried to go it alone with the vamps. From now on, we'll do this team-up style. Okay, team. You're still invisible. Oh! Heh whoops. Oh! Hm.


     Aah!  Aah! Ooh! Jake, why didn't you stick to the plan? Pssh. Hey, you want to bump baby lumps? Sick. No. Just try to follow the plans, okay? Yeah. Bleeaghhh! Come on out, cuties. It's safe now.  Now get out of here! Hee hee hee hee.  Hey. You hear something? Up there! It's a fat, fat warrior beat. It's all kshh! Kshh! Kshh!  It calls me forth. Kshh! JAKE: Man, it's probably just puberty calling. MAN: Fighters. Fighters! Seek you glory from the Fight King? FINN: Mmmaybe. Then step forth beyond the moonlight seal to ba-a-a-a-the in blood and glory forever!  Nah. This is a trap. K-pshh! We sniffed out that trap like champs -- tryin' to get us up in that cursed arena. Then I bet the exits would all magically seal behind us. We'd probably have to fight gladiator ghosts. Yeah! That soundsso dumb.  And flippin' awesome!  We're back! Fools! All exits are sealed! Now you must fight my gl-l-adiator gho-o-sts! Yeah. Okay! I'm-a beat you with your own thing! Give it up! Ha-ha! Ohh! Hyperion, I'm sorry. Hyperion! My love. GLADIATOR: I'll kill you for breaking your promise! Aah! Ugh! Yeah!  Good! Take these branches of palm! Yeah! That prize kind of stinks. Let's go, Finn. My thighs hurt. Aw, man. Okay, it was fun. I'm keepin' the branch. Where do you think you're going?! You must earn thy freedom by defeating each of my ghosts. When you are ready, speak the Fight King's name, and I shall raise you for battle. BOTH: Whoa! Ooh! Hmm. Okay. I have a plan. We'll do what the Fight King says and defeat his ghosts to earn our freedom. You're gonna follow my plan, right? Mm-hmm. But, hey, if you replace me with a dummy, I could stay down here and dig for lava! Then I'd forge a molten hula-hoop! That's an entirely different plan than my plan. What's the hula-hoop for? Morale, dude! This tomb will be as fun  As a tropical island Check it out, dude!  Pat pat pat pat pat.  Badabada! It's a dirt dummy Jake -- just like in the plan!   We're ready, I guess, Fight King. Gladitoria continues for you, human. And, uh, uhdog? Yep. This is dog. Arise, Priscus, Verus! Raaawrr! Yaahh!  Forgive me, Priscus. Pity. The dog falls.  Et tu, Verus? The combat endeth. Now come closer, champion. Dig! Dig! Dig! Dig! Dig! Dig! Dig!  Two gangs? Something crazy's goin' on up there. It's me, Jake -- being here the whole time.  Come closer, my champion. You have proven worthy of my favor.  Word. Uhthis is bad. Accept your prize.  Mm! Hwa! Hwa! Hyah! Hyah! Finn? Ah! The dog li-i-ves. Yeah, I lives. Finn, come with me, man. Raah! Whoa! Dude. Sorry, man. But you crossed my kill zone. FIGHT KING: Fighters, rest now. Hwa! Hwa! Hwa! Hwa! So How's your side of the plan going? Yaah! Plan? What plan? To escape. I dig and stuff and you fight to win. 'Member? Yeah, I fight To hear bones breaking and meat tearing. Ghosts don't got meat. I fight to fight!  Hmm.  Finn is acting weird. Probably due to a decrease in morale. Got to get him that lava hula-hoop! We're ready for our next fight, Fight King! Hwaah! Got to livin' up this unhallowed ground For Finn!  On a tropical island underneath a molten lava moon Hangin' with the hula dancers, askin' questions, 'cause they got all the answers Kick! Habet!  Amazonia! I'm sorry! This next takedown is for you, my King!  Unh!  UhI need your forgiveness.  Puttin' on the lotion Sittin' by the ocean Rubbin' it on my body  Non pugnant, flamma!  Eludere! Huygh! Cum Missione, my friend. Hoc habet! Hwaah! Achillea! I have defeated every gladiator. No! For there is one more opponent! Who?! Your dear companion.  Hyugh!  Get me out of this ca-a-a-ve 'Cause it's nothin' but a gladiator gra-a-a-ve And if I stick to the pla-a-a-n I think I'll turn into a lava ma-a-a-n I think I'll turn into a lava man Why do you stop? Fight King, this Jake was a farce! Let me face the real Jake!  Then this is round 2, my vassal. Take his head for me! Yes, my King. What about the plan?! This is the plan, Jake. Raah! You're gonna kill me? That's right! Everything has been building to this -- the final battle! Brother against brother -- to the death! JAKE: No! Yes! Ye-e-e-e-s!  Fight King! I can't do it. I can't kill him, Fight King. I can't kill my best friend. Finn Not without a bigger sword! Yes! Finish him!  No! Raah!  Wink. What?! Dude, did you -- was that all fake? Did you act all that out? Was that a part of your plan? Mm-hmm.  So you planned to get all cozy with the Fight King and almost kill me from the get-go? Pretty much. Why didn't you say so? Because you always bungle my plans. But if you had bungled this one I might have for real chopped your head off.  That's some funky junk, brother.  Hey, Jake. You notice how all these ghosts are walkin' in pairs. Oh. yeah! I bet they're like us -- best bros who got trapped in that arena. But now they're free.    


(mouse squeaks) (penguins chirp) (screeches)  (dance music plays, indistinct conversations) Denise, we have concluded you're an interesting and conventionally hot woman. My siblings and I would like to request a date with you. Are you available for a date with Glob on Saturday, Grod on Friday, Grob on Thursday, or Gob on Sunday? Please select your dates now. - Aaaah-oooooh! That's nice. - Eat it, Lich. - Eat it, Lich. - Whooo! (chomping) What?! No more crackers! Eeeeeee! - Prismo! Prismo! Hey, man, hey! - Hey. - Bad news You ran out of cheese crackers. - What?! No. - Yeah, man. What are you gonna do about it? - Jake. (chuckles) I'm Prismo the wishmaster. We can have all the cheesy crackers we want. (laughs) (chomping) Prismo, you make me happy, Prismo. - Oh, stop! - I'm always smiling when I'm around you. I just noticed that. I always am. I'm always smiling when I'm around you, too. (giggles) - This feels so good. - Peppermint butler! Death! - What's up? - Hey, um, those guys are doing selfies on the Lich. - Is that safe? (chuckles) - Definitely gonna send these to Denise. Oh, yeah, that's fine. He's harmless. Yeah, but why isn't he killing everyone in the room right now Controlling our minds, making us rip each other's eyes out while we buttercup one another? Well, the Lich's primary function is to cause mass death, and since he can't do that while he's trapped in my time room, he's stuck in a standstill, like a machine without a purpose. - I'm so scared right now. - Yikes! - Ah, don't worry. He ain't gonna hurt nobody. Ha! You got a cup on your head. Haha! You dingus! (laughs) - See, he's docile as a lamb. - Hmm. Well, okay. - Then I guess I can go for a selfie, too. - Yeah, man, make your dreams come true. (both laugh) Oh! What time is it? - Hey, yo, clockface! What time is it? - It's 12:30. Ah, boo to that. Yo, Prismo, I got to get back before Finn realizes I'm not home. He gets worried if I stay out too long. - All right. Later, dude. - Laters! - Jake, where were you? - I was, uh, in the All right, man. I'm gonna come clean. I've been doing a lot of partying at Prismo's lately. - Come on, man! I don't even take lady up there. - Dude I found out my - human dad is still alive. - Whoa! What? - He's at some place - called the Citadel. - Whoa! Are are you gonna go see him? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't. Maybe there's a good reason he didn't raise me, like he was probably captured by thieves and kept a slave for years. Yeah. Or maybe he was ambushed in the wild and hid you so you wouldn't - be captured, too. - Yeah. Maybe it's better not to rock - the boat. - But it might also be good to find out if you got any genetic risk factors or allergies or whatever. Plus, you get to see what you'll look like as an old guy. Could be cool. (chuckles lightly) I guess it would be okay to meet him, just to know what I'll look like. Cool. Oh! If we hurry, Prismo might still be partying. - Come on! Just one more game. - I don't know, Mang. I was just gonna, like, clean up - and crash out. - Aw, yeah! More play-ahs! (groans) - You guys want to play some card wars? - No. - Prismo, we need to get to the Citadel. - Whoa! You guys do not want to go there Seriously. Check this out. The Citadel is a nastisized prison. Only the worst of the worst end up there. Real stinkfaces. These guys are the pits - The armpits. - Hey, my dad must be, like, the warden there. I know you can't grant me and Finn any more wishes, so we brought Shelby along to wish - on our behalf. - Hello. - Ha! Look at that A little - guy. - So I wish for A pony for my G.F.! - Done. - Shelby! - Sorry, dudes. My girl's been hounding me for a pony for months. I'm gonna mad points for this. (cellphone rings) Oh, hi! Oh, so you got it? That's great. You like him? Uh-huh. You're gonna name him what? - Speedboat? Yeah, that's a good one. - Dang, Shelby. A wish wouldn't have worked anyway. You can only get to the Citadel - committing a cosmic crime. - So, what do we got to do Rob a cosmic bank or steal - a space baby? - Hoo! Uh, I just remembered I got to go home. Got to groom my feathers. Goodbye. Goodbye! Listen, if you guys are serious about this, all you got to do is find a certain sleeping - old man and bring him here. - That's it? - Yep, he's on one of those floating islands out there. It kind of looks like an upside-down duck. - That doesn't seem like much of a crime. - Yeah, but that's all there is - to it For now. - What? - Check it out. - I got gifts for you guys. - Heh! Cool. It's a pen light. Bazoo! Zoooo! Vroom! Jake, don't look directly in the Aaaaah! (energy buzzing) - Oh! Oh, sorry. - Pa-choo! Pa-choo! - Pew! Pew! - Pa-choo! Pa-choo! - Pew! Pew! (clears throat) Come on, Finn. Let's go find this old guy. Oh, one last thing, dudes. Whatever you do, don't wake him up. Okay, you can go now. Pew! Pew! You ever wonder what happened to make a place all wrecked up like - this? - Nope. Hey, upside-down duck! No, wait, it's right side up. Ah-ha! - Hey! Get out here, old man! - Dude, shh! Don't wake him up. Hey, get out here, old man. Bazow! Old man. (mutters) Beep. Beep. Beep. (groans) (hissing) Uh-oh! Finn, a little help. (hissing continues) Bazap! (glass shatters) (groans) (hissing) Hmm. Kazow! (glass shatters, energy) (buzzes) Let's hoof it! (grumbling) Jake, don't jostle the package. (all hissing) Hut! (glass shatters) All right. - Oh! (all hissing) - There's too many of - them! - Let's see here. (energy hums) (steam sizzles) - Oh, hey! You're back. - Dude's got serious - night terrors. - What now, Prismo? - Okay. Wake him up. - What?! - Yeah. I just wanted one last look at - myself. - Wait, this old man is you? That's right. Prismo is nothing but the dream of a wrinkly old man. Man, I've gotten a lot hairier, but also balder. Tell me how that makes any sense. I look like a big, old hairy raisin. - So, wait, what happens to you when we wake him up? - Poof! I'm a goner. - Thus ends mighty Prismo. - Prismo. - Killing a wishmaster is a cosmic crime. Once I'm dead, the guardian will show up and take you to the - Citadel. - I don't think seeing my dad is worth sacrificing your - life. - Ah, don't worry! As soon as my corporeal body - falls asleep again in a thousand years, I'll be back. - You sure about this? Hold on, let me take one last look around. Huh, thought I'd own more stuff - by now. Okay, let's do it. - Still feels like a bad - idea, man. - Psh, what could go wrong? - Wake up. - But wait! I've changed my mind! (gasps) (gasps) Prismo, don't worry! - I'll put the old man to sleep and get you back! - Dude, that means the - Lich jacked our entry into the Citadel! - Aw, no, man! - How you gonna see your dad?! - Hello? Who are you guys? Could any of you strangers tell me how to go home? I'm done with my nap. - Old man Prismo. (breathing heavily) - I just woke up from my nap. Uh But I'm ready to go back to bed. I'd like to go home and take a - nap. - No, old man Prismo. Don't talk to him! Are you my son? (gasps) (growling) Old man Prismo! No! Lich, I'm gonna kill you! (screams) (laughs) (static warbles) (ice creaking) (laughs) (laughing stops) Oh, dang! I think they're going to the Citadel. I'm coming, daddyyy! Wait, wait, wait, wait! (both grunt) Look, Jake, more guardians. The Citadel, I presume. - Likely so. - Hey, do you think maybe one of them could be my dad? Nah, I don't think so. We'll probably know when we see him. Right. Right. That makes sense. (humming) (static warbles) Hey, the Lich, again. This must be where the prison cells be at. See? Good riddance, too. I hope you rot forever, you awful jerk flapper. Some people just make the world a worse place to be, just by being around, Jake. That's right. Bad apples. Lock 'em all up, I say, at the bottom of the ocean, where it's too dark to see. Look at that weird, old kid down there. He looks just like you. - Man, look at his clothes. - Daddyyy! - Wup! (thud!) Aah! All locked up in there. Do you think maybe he's a criminal, too? Well, it had crossed my mind. (groans) Geez, man! I wish I hadn't said all that stuff before. Now my heart feels yellow and green. (groans loudly) (sighs) Maybe we shouldn't even have come here. - Whaaaaaa?! (blowing rapidly) - Jake, what did you do?! - It wasn't me! It came from up there! - Gah! He's melting the crystal all up! Breaking cats out left and right! - Turning cats grey! (roars) - Did he trick us, again? - I think he did. - Hey, kid! (blows) Hey, do me a favor. Get me out of here, huh? This fire smells crazy! (glass shatters) (groans) Thanks, kid. Now, where'd you guys park your starskipper? This place is coming down quick, and I'm talking quick like zip-zip, like wow. - Like boom-boom wow. (whimpers) - Oh, we we don't have - a starskipper. - Also, Finn's your son. - Whaaat?! - No starskipper. (clears throat) - I said, "Finn's your son". - He came a long way to meet you. - Son? Oh! Hey, good for you, kid. In other news, I still got to get out of here, and the ground is melting. - Huh. It's all pooling in the center. - Hey, um, I I wanted - to ask you something. I Well - Hup! Hey, wait up! (muffled) Dad! Wait! (gasps) (both gasping) Dad, I wanted to ask you Whoaaaah! Aaaah! (all groaning, gasping) (coughing) Aah! (energy warbles, train whistle blows) - No! - Gree nah gah bah ga da da brahdada! - Gra gra gra gra bra! (laughs) - Finn, I know we normally come out of these things okay, but I got a bad feeling about this. Just promise me If both my eyes get fried off, you'll fry yours off, too. What? No. Listen, you don't got to worry about a thing, Jake old pal. We just need to defeat those five space villains, hijack the shard they're hijacking, and sail it home to safety. Easy peasy. Yeah, Jake, smarten up. Soon as the last guardian dies, the fighting stops. See? He's biting the dust right now. (screams) (groans) Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh (weakly) - It's Okay. It's okay. - Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh. - Uh-oh, uh-oh. - You just got to fetch me a gob of that guardian blood, son. - It's got that good nooch that keeps us young in the crystal. - Nooch? - Come on, now, partner. No doddling. Your old man needs you. (tink!) (sighs) Attaboy, Flynn! Do it for your old man! Yeah, just get right in there! Don't be shy! (grunting) (splash!) Yeah! Hey, good job, son. Now rub some of that sap on my leg there. Make sure to get it into the chicken-wing hole. (groans) - Dad? - Martin. - Okay, Martin. - We need to talk. - Yeah, okay, kid, but hurry it up. I'm trying to act cool here, but this thing really stings! (inhales deeply) - Why did you abandon me in the forest when I was a little baby? - Oh! I mean (chuckles) - you know me. I'm a funny guy. - Wha Wha (exhales deeply) I don't know. It was a long time ago. Who knows? Like, maybe you left me. (sighs) But, hey, daddy's back! (grunts) You and me, daddy and baby. Or should I say, "baby and daddy"? Now slap that sap. (groans) Uck. Whoa! Would you look at that? Smooth like new. (scoffs) - Couldn't fix the boot, too, huh? - Dude, s'mores important junk happening! Look! (bubbling) It's time to peel bananas on this fool as a family! How about it, Martin? - Dad? - I got to run to the store! (groans) (explosion) Huh? Fall. (groans softly) (laughs) (groans) You are alone, child. (groans) There is only darkness for you, and only death for your people. These ancients are just the beginning. I will command a great and - terrible army. (groaning weakly) - And we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished. You are strong, child. But I am beyond strength. I am the end. And I have come for you, Finn. (groans weakly) (gasps) Gah! (groaning) What? You don't like this stuff, huh? (whimpering) Right in the doorbell. Dad! - Jake, finish off the Lich! I got to go catch my dad! - Dude, forget that - loser! (humming) - Dad! Wait! Hey, cool guys. Looking for a new boss? (tink!) (chomping) Chew faster. That guy's really moving. (rip!) Hyup! Ugh! (groaning) - Dad, stop! - Finn! (groans) - Martin, I won't let you escape! - Hey, hey! You're a void caster, right? We got to put some Gas in this buggy. (energy warbles) Finn, let go! He's not worth it! (screaming) (gasps) Oh, gross! Pedal to the medal. (energy warbles) (screams) (gasps) Hey, what about air It'll be okay, dude. (sighs) I mean, at least you finished off the Lich, right? Oh, yeah, that's the good news. I didn't have to. One sec. Up you go! Check this out. Brand-new baby. The Lich is super cute now, and he smells real neat. That sap rebooted him or something. (lips pop) - I like him a lot. (train whistle blows) - Over here, fellas! Next stop The Candy Kingdom. Previous stop This weird place. Mr. Pig, I think we should get a d (doorbell rings) - Okay, run. Go, go, go! - Oh! Oh, this changes everything! Hello!

Tell Bubblegum I wear her nightgown! Tell everyone! Huh? Bonnie! Marceline. What up? Ugh. Why didn't you tell me you got throne-jacked?! I gotta hear it from that wax fraud! Be cool, Marceline. Let's all be real cool. Give us a minute, Peppermint Butler. Hmm! Hup, hup, hup, hup Well? I didn't get jacked. I quit. But yeah, all right, I should've told you. I was just embarrassed. And it all happened so fast. I'm still trying to sort things out, see things rationally. Huh. Well, you could have talked to me about it. Yeah, 'cause you're so dang rational. Ha ha. I'm sorry. That's mean. I'm trying to be less mean. That's why I'm starting fresh with a new kingdom out here Just me, Pep But, some pretty stars. Ugh. And, of course, some varmints. - Varmints? - Varmints! Raiding my pumpkin patch every dang night! After all my sweet bio-engineering? The nerve of these varmints. Not tonight! So, how long you gonna sit out here for? Long as it takes. Uh, all right, yeah. Let's get these varmints. Um yeah. Pbbbb, pbht-pbht-pbht-pbht, pbht, pbht, pbht, pbht-pbht-pbht. These must be pretty good pumpkins, huh? They're citizens of my garden kingdom That reminds me So I was in the Grocery Kingdom last Sunday, 'cause free samples, you know. They had these, like, shrimp cocktail dealies. So good! I was sucking the sauce off them and hucking the shrimp at the ceiling. I kept going back for more and more samples. I could not stop myself. I don't know, man. The shrimp must have gone bad or something, 'cause all that red came right back up. Still invisible and yakking red all down the produce aisle. It was awesome. Hey, you remember that one time Hey! Varmints! After them! Varmint hole! Aw, nuh-unh! A ding dang varmint hole. I can't believe my sweeps didn't find it. Well, you found it now. So, what next? Next? We dig. Hmm. This looks like a delivery tunnel from the old rock-candy mines. Huh! We Haven't been down here in hundreds of years. Remember when I'd get you out of those stinky cheese kingdom trade meetings and we'd sneak down here and spray-paint the walls? Um, I am pretty sure it was me who found you  vandalizing my property. Yeah, but I got you to tag something, didn't I? I bet I could find it. Here. Come on. We used to follow the mine car rails, cracking jokes, telling stories. Whoa! The broken bridge! Remember? You jumped across this! You were so scared. Mm, I think I was just trying to prove something. Bonnibel Bubblegum Always so prepared. Yeah, I have to be "always so prepared." We can't all just "wing it." I didn't have to always worry about so many things, you know? The Candy Kingdom used to be so small, so manageable. But then it kept growing and growing, and there was always some new disaster to prepare against. Is that why you stopped talking to me? No, I Bring it, ya dern pumpkin munchers! It's a freakin' mother varmint! Ugh! Marcy, cover me! No problem. Yaaaaaaaah! Psh! Uaaaaaaaaaagh! Gah! Yah! Ew! Marceline! Look out! Huh? Unh! Ugh! Marcy! Ugh! She's going to bring the whole tunnel down! Yeesh! My snap-back! Marceline: In there! You got any more gadgets? Um Some bandages, a pen, unpaid Internet bill, and a strawberry lip balm. Ahh. Maybe we can find something useful around Ohhhh! Your tag! We actually found it. Man, your handwriting hasn't changed at all. Still as prissy and prim as What? Hey, hey! Whoa. Wait. I didn't mean I like your handwriting. I think it's Really pretty. It's it's not that. I lost my hat. We can Get you another hat. I lost my hat, lost my home, lost my people. I can't even keep dern varmints out of my pumpkin patch! Oh, Bonnie, you're I tried. I really, really tried. I just I thought that if I shut everything out and just focused on work, it would all be okay.  But look where that landed me. All I managed to do was push everyone away. I pushed you away. I'm sorry, Marceline. I've been a real dinger to you. Come on. What are you even apologizing for? Unh! Oof! Uh how about we not get buried under a metric ton of rock-candy rubble? The field generator! Aw, geez! Okay, uh, maybe I can rig up a graffiti bomb or a rudimentary rock-candy cannon or or What? This time, I'm prepared. I've been watching these dudes pretty close. I think I can varmint-style dig us through the wall. It's just a shame about your tag. I don't want to mess it up. Naw. It's good, I think. Mess it up. Dig, dig, dig, dig! Yo! Varmints! Ya hungry?! I'll eat you! I'll eat your mom! I'll eat your eggs! I'll Whoop! Thanks. Boing! I'm crazy-tired, Marceline. I think I have been for a long time. But those varmints are still out there, waiting. Eh, worry about it tomorrow. I'll keep a lookout tonight. I will watch the heck out of this pumpkin patch. Come on. Well, okay. Maybe for a bit. Don't let me sleep too long. Promise to wake me up in 15 minutes. I promise. Uh can I come back now?


     -  - What's up? Nothing. I don't know. If anybody wants some tea, it'll be ready in a few minutes.  Aah! Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil. Evil! Whoa! Flame King! Father! Oh. Uh, uh, I'm sorry. I-I thought my daughter was alone.  I'll just be going. Uh, nice teapot. Ew. What was that? He was saying, "evil, evil, evil," over and over again. Yeah, I-I heard. Oh, I wasn't sure if you heard, 'cause he was whispering. Yeah. I heard. Ugh. He's so annoying. I was just trying to help! Oh, no. Not you Jake my dad. I always catch him whispering stuff into my ear while I'm not paying attention. He keeps saying I'm evil. Whoa. You best not be believing that whack bunk. He's trying to make your life bad so you'll think you're evil. But you're really not! How can I know for sure? - Dungeons. - What? Let's go have a good time in a dungeon or something. That always clears my head and reminds me of what's what. And that'll make me good? No. That'll show you not to worry so much, 'cause you're already good in here. Okay. Yeah! Let's do it! - Dungeons! - Dungeons! - BOTH:  - Chamomile tea.  Is this how you look for a dungeon? Ye-e-e-ah. A lot of times, the entrances are hidden, so you got to look under rocks and stuff for a secret switch. Sometimes it takes a while. Hmm. I'll just use my heat sense.  That tree over there is not made of wood. Really? Ha ha! Yes!  Yeah. Whoo! Ha ha! Yeah! Ooh! Gauntlet!  Thanks for taking me out, Finn. No prob, Bob. Light this for me, will ya? Oh, sure.  Uh, do we need a torch? I'm sort of made of fire. Oh. Well, I guess torches are just cool for dungeons, you know? Oh. Okay. Yeah, I'd like to hang onto it. Boy, this place is creepy. Really? I feel like it's trying too hard. Gold piece! Oh, you mean, like, with all the skulls? - Whoa. Whoa. - What? Hey! What are you doing here? Burning you alive!  No. No. Wait a sec. Sorry one second. - Sure. He might have important loot on him, so we don't want to just burn him up. Plus, it's a little cruel, even for an evil guy. Check this out.  You're gonna surrender! -  -   Okay. Okay. I surrender. I shall grant thee clemency if you do the splits. Do the splits! I-I can I can't do the s-splits. Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie! Okay. Okay.  Okay. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. See? A lot of times you can overpower these guys with confidence. Neat. Got any loot on ya? Just this map. It'll it'll help you. Ha! See? This would have been burned. Yeah no, that makes sense. - What else ya got? - A-a-a-a-aah! There's a treasure chest in the corner. Please stop yelling.  I knew it. Aw! Cram it to the butternuts it's locked! I don't know where the key is! Please don't yell!  All right. We can come back to that later. Hey, are you having fun? Uh-huh. I I'll just stay here. Race you to the next monster! Whoa! Whoa! - What? -  Well, that's not how you do things in a dungeon. You gotta sneak. - Sneak? Like this. And you gotta look around. Tah, tah, tah. Tah. Tah. Okay, this guy is too big to intimidate, but I have a plan. First, you shoot some fire at that rope. The chandelier falls, distracts the monster. We run in element of surprise. - Wow. - You ready? Yeah. Before we go in, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire? Uh, what? Like on a scale of one to a hundred, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire at a rope 50 feet away? Uh Scale of one to a hundred. - 42. - 42! Well, I don't know. I never rated myself. No, that's cool. That's cool. Just try and hit that rope.   Hmm.  - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm good. - It's a hologram. - Oh. Neat. So, uh, should we keep going? Yeah. Although, it does raise the question why would someone go through the trouble of setting up a hologram unless they've hidden something in this room? Hey! Wake up! I was meditating. Look what I fo-o-und. A key. We have to go back? We don't have to we get to. Come on. Ah.  Dungeon crawl It's the greatest crawl of all No crawl's too small For a dungeon crawl  See? That didn't take long at all. And now we get treasure. Okay. Nope. This key is for something else.  Oh, well.  A dungeon crawl It's the greatest crawl of all We're going back to where we were It's a dungeon crawl   Geez, this is kind of boring. At least he's walking fast.  Do, do, do  That's where I found the key.  -  - Snap dragons! Take my place. Take my place. Take my aah! Scatterfire!  No! No! We shake them down first, remember? He wanted me to take his place. Man. Ooh! Hold on.  Ha ha! It's another key! We get to go back to the beginning. Whoo-hoo! Finn, I'm not having any fun. What? Why? Well, you keep wanting me to do things your way, but I don't like doing things your way. Is that because I am evil? What? No way. That's no! Uh hey, you know what? Let's do things your way. - Really? - Yeah. I've been acting an uncouth lout, milady. Okay. So there's a door over there. What do you want to do? I burn it down. Okay. Yeah. That worked. Now what do you do? - Yee. Aah. Good good job, F. P. Thanks, "F" the "H."  Ugh! Doors. Burn! Burn! Burn!  What? Oh, sham, ma'am. It's a legion of goo skulls! Uh, how do you defend?  Snake fire!  Fire burn goop. Yes! Feel my flames, puny worms!  The power of destruction! Aah! Flame Princess! Hmm? Help me! But don't use fire 'cause, well, you know, it  Release him! Or feel the wrath of the Princess of Flames! Pbht! Very well.  Do the splits! Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie!   Whoo! Hot Daniel, Flame Princess. I thought you were going to burn me alive. No way. I'd never do that to my boyfriend.  Thanks, Finn. That was a really awesome experience. Dungeons totes clear your head, right? Mm-hmm. I forgot how good it feels to destroy stuff. - Uh - I mean, like, evil stuff. Oh, yeah. Cool. We should go again sometime. Do you know of any other dungeons? Maybe next time we should just go to, like a farmers' market. And burn it. Hmm. Try this key.  -  - What is it?  


     Ugh! Where the turds is my demonic wishing eye?! Ugh! I've looked everywhere! Aw!  What is it, girl?  You know where it is? Lead the way! Oh, boy, this is just wonderful! Hmm. Ah, you just want me to brush you! You know this brush is for Princesses only! Ahh, Princesses only -- no Gunthers! What are my options here? Hmmhmm, hmm. Oh! Gunther! What is your damage today?! Ooh! Wizard Market! "WlZ"  Hey! You're really peeving me off, Gunther! Go stand in the corner!  I said stand in the corner. Ugh, you make me sick.  Try not to break anything while I'm gone!   Meow!  Gunther? Uh Jake, we gots penguins.  Hmm, huh? Hmm? Oh, yeah. Thanks. Come on, you guys, get off me now. Wah, wah! Grah! ALL: Wah, wah, grah! Jake? Huh?  Hey! Hyah! Now, shoo, you little creeps! Oh, this is unusual.  Glib -- dringle!  What's with these super penguins? I don't know. I'm guessing it's the Ice King. Well, where is he then? Ice King! ICE KING: Wizards rule. Let's see. That's the symbol for magic items, right? Hey, this is the Magic Items Shop, right? What's it look like, ya donk? I know that! I know! Why can't they write it on the sign, though? Why's it all got to be secret? Let's just put it all out there, huh?! Equal distribution of magic to the people! No more symbols! No more initiations! You feeling me, Huntress wizard? You trying to get killed, Ice King? Nah, I was just stepping to you, girl, with my intellectual wizard politics. No, don't go. Well, "Swing at every ball," -- That's what Jay T. Dawgzone says. Hello? WIZARD: So then he was telling me to beef in the eye of glob and stuff. Whoa, did you do it? Heck yes, I did! Yo, I wouldn't do that. Get over it, man. Don't you want to reach the highest initiation of the secret schools? Of course, man -- "In shadow, we find the light." ALL: "Safely sealed in darkest night, so make sure y'all keep it tight, wizards only, fools." Keep what tight? A secret you never should have heard, Ice King! Yo, guys, chill. I lost my demonic wishing eye. Just give me a new one, and I'll jet. I didn't hear nothing about no weird Secret Wizard Club that I want to be a part of. Loose lips sink the ships, Ice King. Sorry, man, nothing personal. Oh, sliz Aah! You guys, Stop! Aah!  Okay, I give up.  BOTH: Gunther? Nice Ice. FINN: What's going on here, man? Call off your super bros! JAKE: Oh, that's great! Where's the Ice King, Gunther?  Gunther! What? All right. Whoa! BOTH: Wha?! Is this happening everywhere? I don't know. Let me see. Whoop. Dang! What do you see? Hold on. Oh, no! No! What, dude? Hold on, man, wait. Oh, glob! This can't be happening! Tell me! Eh, it's over. We've been conquered. Who's been conquered? Everyone. By the Ice King? No, dude -- by Gunther. Holy shmow! Give me that! Gunther's headed for the Candy Kingdom! We got to save them! Whoa! Okay! Hurry, Jake! Wait, I'm still in my pajayjays.  Yo, Finn, are you seeing these penguins? Yeah, it's Gunther! He's taking over the whole thing! Well, he'll have to beat my Banana guards and my Gumball guardians. That's not gonna work! What did he say? He says your plan is bunk. Well, what's your plan? i I got a plan! You do? When we get there, I'll do my plan in addition to your plan -- two plans! Laters! Uhall right. So you're not gonna tell me y-- I'm outties! You're not gonna tell her the plan? No, I got to be mysterious. What?! I thought you weren't into Bubblegum anymore. I'm not, but this is how I act now with all the ladies, you see. I keep 'em in a state of confusion. That way, I've always got options in case Flame Princess doesn't work out. Oh, my gosh! Where is this coming from? It's called "Future farming." I read it in that book you have by Jay T. Dawgzone. Jay T. Daw-- Aww, dude! Don't read that book! It's gonna mess up your brain! I keep that book around for laughs. It's all really bad advice. Oh, okay, I'll stop it then. No, well you can still be mysterious. That's fine. What? Now I'm confused. Never mind! I didn't say nothing. Hey, P Bubs. Are you ready? Yes! The cavalry is standing by. Cool. I'm gonna rally some citizens and do this other plan. Okay, but what -- Good luck! Jake, what's with all the mystery? Uhoh, snap, look out! Banana guards, defend! Aw. geez! Evil presence detected! MustdefendCandyKing-- Aah!  You'll never get past these walls! I think!   This is my plan! I got the Candy Kingdom underground to help me collect all the bottles in the land!  Breaking news -- That mystery plan of yours is a smash hit!  Because of the glass. I guess all they care about is bottles, huh? But what'll happen when they run out of bottles? I won't let that happen, Prubbs.  Stay back!  Wait a minute! Put away your weapons, and we'll get you more bottles! Peeb, there aren't any bottles left. I have a third plan. Sowe make them new bottles, then the Gunthers break the bottles, and then we pick up the glass and make new bottles again? Yep. What, like, forever? Yes. Bubb, your plan bunks.  Yeah. I like it. I got a rhythm going! Dink-dink, da-dink-dink, tink-tink-ta-tink, ta-ta-tink, ta-da-da-dink, dink-tink, tink-ta-tink, ta-ta-tink-tink, dink-da-da-dink, da-da-da-da-da, da-dink!  What? What do you want? I don't -- He wants to smash the Gumball guardian's head! We're going to make more bottles. Just wait, okay?  ALL: No!! Goodbye, Princess. No.  ICE KING: Hey! What's going on here? Why's this place all crazy? I was just flying by and --  Gunther! You took my stuff!  That's bad! You know what you get now?  That's right! You get the squirty-squirts. Bad! Bad! Now take off my demonic wishing eye! All right, Gunther, now go home!  That's right! Walk! While you're walking home you think about what you did!  It's getting worse and worse with him. He just -- he hates it when I leave the castle. I'm sorry, guys. Uh, dude, where have you been?! Yeah, and why are you all jacked-up?  Well, I got into some crazy wiz-biz over at Wizard City. Honestly, I don't even know how I survived. Basically, it was the craziest showdown ever. I -- I wish I could tell you all about it, but, you know, "Wizards only, fools -- keep it tight."   This party is so crazy!


  Come on, Marci. It'll only hurt for a second. That's nothing in the face of eternity. A second hurts really bad in the face of eternity. But only for a moment. Wait. I have an even better idea. Sunscreen SPF 10 Million. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm! I have exactly enough to reach my umbrella. Ha! You really like chopping wood, huh? I'm not chopping wood. I made a toothpick from the ancient elm. See? Uh, knock, knock. What the dip, Marceline? Sorry. It was supposed to be a joke. Actually, I have something really serious to ask. I want you to do the procedure, the one we talked about. I'm sorry, but I don't think you'd make a good blonde. No, not that. I don't want to be a vampire anymore. Oh, my globness. You said you were working on a cure, right? Well, the machine is built and the serums are ready, but are you sure you want to do this? I'm sure. Some bad things happened to me when I was little. When I became a vampire, I was just a messed-up kid. Now it's 1,000 years later, and I'm still messed up. I don't want to spend eternity like this, with this emptiness. I want to grow up. Okay. Let's do this. This means someday you'll die. You know that, right? I guess that will be my last adventure. Marceline I'm so very, very, very excited to test my new lab out on you. Well, don't get all sentimental on me. Come on over here. You know I care about you. I think you're making the right choice. Your natural life spend is going to be richier and fuller than you can imagine. And someday, when you die, I'll be the one who puts you in the ground. But, you know, this operation might not even work. Whooooooooa! This tickles really bad! Did it work? Well, I sucked all your vampire effluvium into this bucked. Possibly we won't know the results for a couple of days. In the meantime, you need to get plenty of rest. I'll check your vitals in the morning. Thanks, P. Brains. No! Huh? It's breakfast time for my sweet babies. Sweet babies! Operator! Put me through to Finn and Jake. It's an emergency. Victim's lost a lot of blood. Clean entry wounds. It's an expert job. Poor miss baby. She used to be my best cream cow. But now her milk is nonfat. And nanette, my beautiful calf is decaf! That's terrible! Every farm in our village was attacked. Not a goat or a cow or a duck left un-sucked. Well, I've heard enough. Come on, Finn. Let's go arrest Marceline. Wait a minute. We don't even know if Marceline did this. That's right. I forgot about Ooo's extensive vampire community. Come on! Yeah, but we need to conduct a proper investigation. I know that. Ain't no rookie. All right, come on. I'll let you be bad cop. I'm already bad cop. Okay, let's not pay seeds. Me and my partner will "interrogate" the suspect police-style. Meanwhile, you sharpen up your pitchforks mob-style. Yeah! Hey, man, that's not right. Marceline's our friend. Physical contact! Officer resisting arrest! - Boom! - Ow! Ohh, woof. Marceline want to go ny-ny. Don't go ny-ny, Marci. I'm worried. For real? Why? Well, the process was experimental. Like, are there side effects? What happened in your sleep last night? Nobody on record has ever cured vampirism, unless you count killing vampires as curing. In that case, you've cured tons, right? "Tons" is an understatement. That Shnoz was nasty, nasty times. Hey, cover up. The sun's hitting the door. I'm still undead? We don't know yet. So just chill. Oh, hey, guys. How you doing? Jake did excessive force on me. I'm sorry. - Let me kiss it! - Ew! Ew! Hurry up. Get in here. You done it this time, Marceline. You sucked the life out of defenseless animals! I ain't done nothing. You think I'm buying that boom-boom mountain? Oh, get some proof. You want proof? Look. Whoa! Proof of how off I'm gonna go if you don't confess. Yo, chill, Jake. I'm wilin' out! Listen, Marci, I can barely control this guy, and the villagers are getting crazy. They want to run you over with a wagon, and I'm offering you a way out. Hey, dillweeds, I just swept the place. Sorry. Finn, be real for a second. All right. Look into my eyes, man. I didn't do it. To be honest, it looks like you're not sure if you did it. Okay, I'm not sure! Something weird happened last night. I had a weird dream about stuff. Dream stuff always means something. We'll figure this out, Marci, together. - We promise. - Thanks, Finn. That's cool, you guys, but clean this mess, also, you bums. He's a gob-gleebin' vampire hugger! We got to tell the town! Book it, Terry! Run, Terry! Run! How long do we have to stay in the laundry house, cloud dance? Until Finn and Jake avert the threat. We can't afford to lose more livestock. We're struggling as is to keep our kids fed. Let's just stay in here until the dirty vampire gets what's coming to her. But I want to bop her in the nose! Hey, now, it's too dangerous, okay? A small town, we gotta stay close. Each of us play a vital role, and I can't afford losing any of you. Not you, Clubhouse Sandy, or you, Seed Man, or even you, Sandwich Paul. Sensei Paul. Let's leave the fighting to the fighters, okay, Paul? That hurts. You don't know I teach aikido. Finn's been turned! Wha?! He does the vampire's bidding. Well, there it is. Tonight we burn the beast Marceline. Woof. I can barely stand up. Look at this. It's my new dance. It's called "I got arthritis." Ohh. The end. You should have hung back with P.B. But I've got a bad feeling like you guys are gonna die without me. Dang, Marci. Have some faith. Geez. Guys, look. Moo! Get it! You see it? No. But what's that? Must be its filthy lair. What's wrong? Remember how I said my fear of vampires - was based on ignorance? - Yeah. Well, I think that revelation was actually based on true ignorance. So you're scared of vampires again? Yeah, man, don't be ignorant. Come on. Okay, but I'm gonna hold on to your shirt. Look at these poor babies. What's happening to them? Y-y-you tell me, m-man. Moo. I think they're in the process of being turned, eh? Ugh, glob. Something big just dropped in my gut. Hang in there, bro. I can't be here, man. It's too real. Wait, you hear that? Listen. There! A little help. Jake! Hey, get back here! Dang! Lost him! Marci? Hey, Marci, you still out here? She's still out here, all right. Oh, hey, man. Did you see a scary beast go by? I chased it out here, but it got away. Oh, we found that beast, and we took care of her real nice You vampire hugger! Wait, what? Lookum yonder. What the blood? You dumb bumbags! Now look at the other yonder. Huh? Oh, fudge! You're sick, man! What's wrong with you? What? I'm the good guy here. You're gonna explode my friend. Blow her up! Blow her up! Oh, flip, you're right. This is way messed up. Run, Finn! You got to beat the sun! Go, Finn! Go! Aaaaaaah! Marceline, nooooo! Don't let anyone read my diaries. Burn them, Finn! They're embarrassi Marceline, nooooo! Don't let anyone read my diaries! Burn them, Finn! They're embarrassi And then he said, "fine." That's the story of how I met your Dad. Can I play now? No, Marceline, sweetie. It's nap time. But I don't want to sleep. My dreams are weird. All dreams are weird. But, Mom, my dreams we-e-e-ird. Honey, something weird might just be something familiar viewed from a different angle. And that's not scary, right?  Let's go in the garden You'll find something waiting Right there where you left it Flying upside down When you finally find it You'll see how it's faded The underside is lighter When you turn it around Everything stays right where you left it  Hello, Marci. I don't know if you'll ever hear this message. I fear my thoughts are no longer my own. Just watch over me until I can find my way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity. And then maybe, Betty, my princess Maybe you will love me again. Please love me again, Betty! Okay, bye. Hey, Simon. I, uh, finished packing your gear. So, can I have my tape now? What? No. This is private, silly. There you go. Snug as a bug. Seriously, Simon. Please don't go. I-I have to protect you. How can you protect me if you not even here? I'll arrange for someone to come take care of you. I'll make sure he doesn't leave. Please, Simon, I could help you with this. Yeah, maybe one day you will. But until then, you have to stay brave, my fearless Marceline. Ouch! You see? I have to go now. Goodbye, Marci. Wait! No! Wait! Ohh! Simon! Simon! Gah, ew. Okay, I know you're here. Peek-a-pop! The Fool! You found me, Marceline. Now you're it. We're not playing, Fool. You're an evil, blood-sucking fiend. I'm trying to kill you. Hey, you want to see something funny? I look like a butt. Pbht! Ohh! Huh? Oh. Cool. Sweet music to my ears. Come on, little bun. Just turn around. Ugh, stupid animal. Wha?! Oh! I'm sorry! All right, hold still. There you go. See? It's okay. No, kid! You don't have to be afraid of me! I'm a really good Person. Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys! Huh? There's ohh, hoo A vampire! No! Yes way. I saw it real close. It looked like a girl, but it had fangs like Everybody, ready your weapons. Don't worry. We'll be ready for it. Ohh! Hey. No, no, I-it's cool. I'm on your side. Go away, vampire. I'm in the sunlight. I'm not a flipping vampire! Mm? Mm? What's that? Oh, you want old Two Bread Tom to play the song. Please do not play the song. No. The child is right. As humans, it's our duty to tell the tales, to sing the songs. Art must survive.  Streaks on the China Never mattered before Who cares? When you drop-kicked your jacket As you came through the door No one glared But sometimes things get turned around And no one's spared All hands, look out below There's a change in the status quo-o-o Gonna need all the help that we can get  You want me to play more? Yes, please. The consensus is that your cover's better.  According to our new arrival Life is more than mere survival And we just might live the good life yet  Hmm? Oh, man, Schwabl, I sure hope there ain't a little vampire kid sneaking up behind me. Vampire atack! Oh, no! Ugh! I'm dead. This is serious, Marceline. What if I was a vampire? You need an animal hat. Looks like the project's coming along, huh? Waaaah! - Hey, Marceline! - Marceline! Two Bread Tom, how's it going, man? Oh, so good. I had a hoagie for lunch. And even better, the ship's repairs are almost done. We should be ready to sail in another day or two. Oh, that's really great. But listen, I've cleared out almost all the vampires that are left. In another week or two, you won't even have to leave. Yeah, Marceline! Oh, Marci, you're such a sweet weird kid. But it's not just the vampires or the oozers or them hungry-looking rainbows. The latest atmospheric readings are going bananas. Something big is coming. And it's gonna change all this. No, we'd do best to clear out of this continent altogether. Hey, you should come, too. After all you're one of us. They're here! They're here! Aah! He's biting my hat! Get to the boat! Oh, geez. Oh, geez. That's not Schwabl, man. Well, you got me. What gave it away? The boots? Aah! Marceline! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hi, there, Hierophant! Why can't you just let us eat humans? You're, like, messing up the natural order. This is our time. It's my time. And once I stake and gank your shape-shifting power, I'll be unstoppable. Ha! What?! I picked up self-healing power last month, off some vamp with a head like a garden trowel. So, you've slain sister moon. Look at you. You're just a hapa demon punk, blind to the price you must pay for such powers. Blah! I don't care! Fine. Ah! Show yourself! Okay. Wah-wah. Ka-ching! Oh, Geez. Hey, Marceline, let me "ax" you something. You get it? You have to leave, Tom. Oh, I didn't think it was that bad. You have to leave now! Aah. He's here. He's the worst of them all The Vampire King. What? Marceline, you're not dead! Whoo! P.B.'s cure. It must have worked! No soy vampire. Also, untie me, please. I'm not a murderer! Okay, but wait, if she's not a vampire, then what's been draining our cows? Aah! Finn? Finn? Geez. I hope Finn didn't get blood-sucked after I stress-fainted. Who the heck is this?


    Oof! Eef! Come back, thief! Whoa! Stop farting on me! lt's gross! You can't just go around stealing boots! JAKE: Yeah! And you know the penalty for stealing boots -- lt's poots on Newts. Uh! He's getting away into that lake! Dude, that isn't a lake. That's an ocean. Woof! Woof! Woof!  Bark! Bark, bark, bark! Huh?  Uh  Poots on Newts! Poots on Newts! No!  Poo-o-o-ts on Ne-e-wts!  l'm comin', Jake. l'll poot on that Newt as soon as l'm barefoot. Aah! Uh.  Wha? Ow! Why is my stomach going nuts?! Ow!  W-w-who are you? l am the manifestation of your fear Fear of the ocean! What?! l'm not afraid of -- of lakes, wells, rivers, streams, or deep wells or puddles. Uh, why would l be afraid of -- Aaah! Uh!  'Cause you're a wu-u-ss. l'm no wuss! l'm the hero 'round these parts! Ha! You're too scared of the ocean to ever be a true hero. Not true! l'm not scared of nothin'! Aaaah! Agh! l shall conquer my fear.  Yeah, right. No, l will. l'll conquer my fear. Of course you will. And l live in a two-bedroom apartment that doesn't smell like vomit.  Sarcasm.  JAKE: Dude.  Dude, did you see me? l was all, like, womp! And then l was all, like, ''Take this!'' Womp! Womp! And then -- Hey, what's wrong with you, dude? Jake, l think l'm afraid of the ocean. Say what, now? l need your help to overcome my fear. Will you do it? Um No, l don't really want to do it. Jake! Come on! Heh. l'm just messin' with you. l'll do it. Hmm. Where to start? Uh, okay. l think we should just take a few steps in the water. You can hold Jaker's hand if you're scared. Um Well, that's okay, dude. l see the problem. lt's just your feet. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop, beep, boop, beep. Beep, boop, beep, boop. Don't want to be scared. l shall not be scared. Boop. Boop.  l'm afraid! Aah! Jake, get me out of the water! Now, Jake, now! Now! Aah! Oh! Oh, oh, oh, aaah! Hot jam. You're really scared of the ocean. ln fact, you're so scared, it gives me an idea. Let's start a business of being scared of the ocean. Jake! Okay, okay. l have a plan to get rid of your fear. We'll start tomorrow morning. But l must conquer this now! Huaaaaa! l'm not afraid of you. Aaaaaaaaaah!  l'm afraid of you! l'm afraid of you! Aaah!  Okay, yeah. Let's try tomorrow.  Finn.  Finn. Hey, Finn, wake up. Mornin', Jake. Ready for me to help you get over your ocean fear? Yeah, man. Cool. But l can only do this if you ask me. l'm askin'. Then get ready for my three-step plan. Watch your troubles melt away with step one!  Aaaaah! Jake, are you crazy?! This is not an okay thing to do! Hey, hey. Come on. The ocean is your friend. And you got friends all around you right now --  Miles and miles of friends. You're nuts. Don't try to struggle, man. l'll let you out in a second. You just need to calm down.  Really? Okay, l'm calming down. That's great. You're doing great. Ready for step two? Yeah, man. l can do it. All right, dude. StepTwo! Aah! Jake, this isn't a joke! lt's touching me! Let it hold you, man! Let it hold you like a child! l'm trylng to let it hold me.  Control your breathing.  This isn't working. That means we got to move to step three. Just don't scream. W-what? l'm gonna push you underwater with my jowls. Just don't scream. Don't scream. Hold your breath, Finn! You got it, dude! Aaah! Get me away, Jake! Now, Jake! Now! Right now! Get me away! Aah! Finn! Stop it! Finn! Ow! Yaaaaah!  Yaaaaaah! l'm safe. l'm safe. How'd l do? l think we should give up. What? l made it all the way to level three. Look, Finn, it's not that l don't want to help you. l just don't want to get beat up anymore. l mean, this is my bread and butter. l can't have you messin' up my bread and butter, dude. You have to help me. l can't do this without you. Okay, fine. But only if you swear not to hit me anymore. l swear l won't hit you anymore. And also swear to only speak in rhymes. Speak in rhymes all the times. l swear. And pigs have hair. Yes. Perfect. And since you want more, it's time for step four. What?! l thought you said it was a three-step plan Man. l'm not that good at counting.  Come on. Let's go kick your fear of the ocean where the sun don't shine -- ln the sea cucumber.  Check it, dude.  Yeah, it's pretty math, you psychopath. You know, it looks way more math if you open up your eyes. Whoa. See, man? The ocean is beautiful. There's no reason to be afraid of things that are beautiful. Hey, this isn't that bad. l'm actually glad. Hey, look -- a black abyss. Let's go check it out, sauerkraut.  No, Jake! Turn around! Turn around! Aaaaah! Saying ''turn around'' twice doesn't count as a rhyme, dude. JAKE: Hey, you swore! Ow! My bread and butter! No, dude, don't! Don't worry, dude. Everything's cool. This is the perfect segue into level five. Here -- put this on.  Just make sure you don't pull the emergency tab. Aah! No, dude! l said don't -- Aah! Oh Jake? Aah! Jake!  Pathetic. You can't even overcome your fear now that your friend is about to die. Your unheroic body will never let you save Jake.  You're right. What? Really? You think l'm right? Well, that's -- that's great. lf my body won't let me rescue my best friend, then there's only one thing left to do. No. Wait. No! Jake! Jake! Wake up! Ugh. You okay, dude? Yeah, man. Wait. Finn! You did it! You conquered your fear! What? You're at the bottom of the ocean!  Aaaaaah! Maybe we should celebrate on land. l'm proud of you, man. You did it. Thanks, dude. You've nothing to be proud of, boy. You will never get over your fear of the ocean! Whoa, dude. What's with your belly button? What the flip, man? l just swam to the bottom. No, you didn't, cheater. You just sank to the bottom. You will never be a great hero. He's right. l'll never be a hero.  Finn, you are wrong. The mark of a great hero ls his flaw. You know nothing, wisemen. Silence, Fear Feaster! We know a lot! Wait. Why did you wait so long to tell me? Because the limo driver's flaw is being late. Sorry.  Farewell, Finn. You truly are the greatest hero of Ooo.  lt's time for you to go away, Fear Feaster! What? Am l supposed to live in your tummy for the rest of my life? Everybody has a flaw. And it looks like yours is smellin' like my nasty guts.  Wonderful. 


    Hey, friend. Don't be afraid. I'm a child like you, running wild and crazy. Hold on. Wow. A falling star. It's too far, though.  Magic!  You're welcome. Hmm. Ah. There. Wait. Oh, glob. He is here somewhere, my brothers. Glob, can you see Magic Man on the sensor? Yes, Gob. Our little brother is very close. - Hey, flip me. - Okay. I'm gonna activate the thingy that drains his magic juice.  My juice! Not flowing right. Dream on, honey. You can't catch this.  Magic away! I think I see him. Yes, I see him, as well. - Hey, guys. - BOTH: What, Glob? Nothing. Never mind.  Wait. Wait. Shh, shh! Shush! I wasn't -- You hear that? It was totally silent for like a whole second. Huh. Oh, yeah. Cool. Sometimes we get so wrapped up battling stuff, we forget to --  Ooh!  Waaa zoo! Hey. Shhhhhh.  ALL: Arise. Magic Man, you caused nothing but turmoil and chaos for us on Mars. We thought banishing you to this world would help you see the light of our utopian super-society. Now, tell us -- what have you learned in these past 200 years? Are you guys talking to me? You know you made life on Mars a nightmare.  Now we must return you to Mars, where vengeance awaits thee. That's not -- Magic Man! Get up! Did it work? Is he gone? Yep.  They took my friend to Mars! Fly me there and help me save him! Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't. You see? The transfer drained me. I can probably barely float. So I just got to wait 'til they kill your friend. See ya!  - No! - Whoa! What do you mean "kill"? They're gonna put him on trial for my crimes. Ain't nobody gonna pardon these crimes on my head -- not even the king of Mars! And once he's dead, my magic juice will return to my body -- flowing through me like moonlight through the ghost dance. - Squeeze! -  I wish I could help except I don't! You succubutt!  Come on, let's go to my house Come on, let's go to my house!   How long have you had this house? Yes, that is true! Well, I bet there's something here that can help me save Jake. There is, but you'll never make it work. What?! Where is it?! I don't know! Have you seen my trash palace? Yeah, what's the deal? This place is wrecked. Ewww! Ew!! What am I stepping in? That's where I blow my nose all day. Ugh! Yes, welcome to my tower of light. Everyone is welcome to share this magic kingdom -- squirrels black mold worms poison ivy tiny manticore.  Help me, you coward! Magic Man, what is your deal, for real? You tell me. Well, for one, I think this house is a reflection of your sick brain. Look at this. Yuck. Who's this you're standing with in this picture?  Memories drift in and out of my mind And the little people get left behind So whatever  All right. Well, I'm gonna keep digging through this stuff 'til I find what you're talking about. It's downstairs. - Huh? What? - My special thing. Whoa!  Holy crepes.  Ta-da! Come on. That's the thing -- my special thing. A Martian transporter.  This can take me to Mars?! Yeah. My brothers gave it to me when they banished me to Earth. They thought I'd learn love and use it to go back home. How do I do it? You put your hands on those thingies and think stuff about people. But it's broken. Hasn't worked in 200 years. But it has to work. It has to. For Jake.  Huh-duh?! Yaaaaaaaah! Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  Whoa!  Citizens of Mars, King of Mars today, the most notorious fiend in Martian history stands before us -- Magic Man. Stop!  Turn on the dark. Okay, so we don't have footage of these crimes, but Grod's pretty good at drawing, so "Plague of Shadows." Magic Man brought our shadows to life. They attacked us and ravaged Mars. Very impressive, Grod. Thanks, bro. To the "Plague of the One-ness." As we gathered to hold hands and sing our community song, Magic Man cast an evil spell that made our arms grow together. Much suffering ensued. And what about that one time when he turned all the water into hair and we all got so thirsty, we drank it? And when we drank it, we went bald? Many of us did not recover and, to this day, hide our loss behind groovy headgear. Dark off, please. Magic Man, it bums me out to see this. I remember when you were really cool, before that night you spent on Olympus Mons with Margles.  Aw, man!  Force field. What happened, Magic? Why did you go crazy? If you had just learned to care about living things again, you could have come back whenever you wanted. Well you guys are missing some important details. I'm Jake the dog. Listen.  You sad Magic Man. Instead, you bummed around Ooo acting like a jerk for 200 years. Yeah, that's true, except I'm not Magic Man! Now! Ready the Wand of Disbursement! ALL: Ready. Space dome, open! Oh, snap!  Magic Man, I give you two choices -- one is total annihilation. The wand will touch you, and your soul will meet with death. The second is to use the power of the wand to convert your body to living stardust, where your consciousness will be jettisoned into the infinite cosmos on an endless journey of wonder and discovery! Wow. That second one sounds pretty cool. I mean, yeah, I'm like way into that. Except -- ohh -- I would really miss my best friend. His name is Finn. And I think it would mess him up if I wasn't around. Wait -- did you say you would miss someone? Yeah. And that someone would miss you? Yeah, that's me, you dishrags!   I win again! Just like always!  Jakey, no!  Look.  It's the dog. The one you were prophesied to meet. I don't care none for that mess! This wouldn't have glomped if you'd just listened to my bro! You bunked up, King of Mars! The wisest, most honest super being of all time just put an innocent dog to deads! You're right, Finn the Human. My judgment was less than the standard by which I judge my peers. Of which I have none. I will retrieve your friend from the 37th dead world. Ooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaah! Death. King of Mars. What's your business? I need this one back. Hmm. What will you give me for him? Not this time, your majesty.  In that case, I offer my immortality. Deal.  Huh? Hey! I'm alive! Yay! King of Mars saved you!  Yes, but at what cost? Oh, man. Should we go get Magic Man? No. I lost a friend. I cannot lose my brother, as well. ALL: Hey, what? Where did they go? Eat my skids! Yaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Oh, Margles. FINN: Magic Man! Huh? Bam!  You're back, coward! Go! Get out of here, tiny manticore! Whatevs! I didn't need your pity help! Geez. What? I am the true coward. Hiding from sincere expressions like a vampire in the nude who hides from the light. Thank you, brave hero. I was freed from bottle jail, but my new prison is shame. My new prison is shame! What's he saying? He said, "my new prison is shame." Well, looks like your new house is done.  Jake, you want to check out the new house? Nah, don't let me interrupt you. You two have fun. I wanna see inside. I love it! Great!  Huh. This doesn't hurt as bad as it used to.  Aaaaaaaaaah! Oh, gob! Oh, gob! Oh, gob! Finn!  I'm okay! Hmm.  Oh! Do the thing that I like.  Now do the thing that I like.   Classic. All right, Finn, that's enough.  Thank you for building my new home, Finn. I'm so happy. You want a hug? Yes. Whoa. Hold on, mama.  Okay, bro, tinfoil's on. You can hug now.  Bye. Bye, Finn. Bye. Looks like your date went pretty good, buddy. Ah, I don't know. Was the hug okay? Give me some tips, mang. Bro, you gotta let things take their natural path. Look. Look, let me explain some junk about dating. Right now you're at tier 1, which is hugging. But pretty soon, you'll be at tier 2, which is smooching. Then down the road, you'll make it to tier 5, where she'll let you discover all 15 feet of her long, beautiful stomach. And after a while, you'll make it to tier 8, where you touch her horn for the very first time. Very special. What about tier 15? You stay away from that! Do not do tier 15! Dude, I got no idea what you're talking about. Don't worry about it, dude. Just let things naturally move to tier 2. Oh, and, um you need a shower, dude. What?!  Oh, gross! Do you think Flame Princess could smell me? - Probably. - Crup. 'Sup, guys? BOTH: Princess Bubblegum?! What are you doing here? Collecting taxes. You guys weren't home, so I let myself in. - Oh. - I'm gonna take a shower. Princess, do not inhale! - What? Why? - Just don't!  What's that all about? Ah, he's just smelly from a day of running around with his lady friend. Ooh! A lady friend. Do tell. Uh, I shouldn't say. It's his business. Oh, come on. You can tell me. That's his personal biz. You gotta respect a man's p-biz. Okay, you're right. I'll respect it. Flame Princess! He was hanging out with Flame Princess. What?! And I don't mean to be telling stories out of school, but pretty soon, they're gonna be taking it to tier 2. No. This isn't possible. Oh, it's possible. I just never thought Flame Princess. I --  I have to go. Morrow!  Hmm. Weird. Guess who's late for their video chat?  President Porpoise! No. No. Oh, gob. I thought I'd be ready for this. Yowwwwwwwwn!  Jake, I'm going to see Flame Princess. Be back later.  Finn!  Aaaah! Okay, Princess, you need to stop breaking in here. I have something important to tell you about relationships. Uh, that's okay, Princess. I just hope you'll understand.  Relationships are like layers of sedimentary rock. Jake, Flame Princess is waiting for me. I'm gonna bounce out. Okay. Tier 2, baby. Word.  BUBBLEGUM: If too much frustration builds, the magma will erupt, causing a catastrophic superstratum of igneous rock to form.  What? Where am I? Jake, you're president now. Oh, my gosh!  Jake!  - Wake up! -  - Jake, where's Finn? - He stepped out. Will you tell him why he can't see Flame Princess anymore? Oh. Ohhh! I see what's going on here. Great. I cannot stress how important it is that they not see each other. Oh, man. PB is totally jealous of Flame Princess!  Jump. Punch. Kick. Kick. - 'Sup, man? - Yo, dude. So, what did PB want? She doesn't want you to see Flame Princess anymore. She's crazy jealous. So, you at tier 2 yet? I got about five hugs. Does that count? Nope!  Well, still at tier 1. I know exactly what'll get you to tier 2 -- a sappy poem. Say something about her spectrum. Ew! Let's see she's bright. She's beautiful. She makes me feel confused. Like something's filling up my chest. Like I can't breathe. Is it because she's so dangerous? Glob, Jake, I-I can't stand it! Inspiratio. - Finn! -  Aaaah! Whatcha doin'? Oh. Uh, hi, Princess. I'm, uh, writing something for Jake. Oh. Well, speaking of Jake, did he explain everything to you? Yeah. - And you understand? - Yeah, I understand. Finn, sometimes you want someone and you want to kiss them and be with them, but you can't because responsibility demands sacrifice. What are you trying to say?! I'm trying to say that you're a hero, Finn. You're my hero. So, I'm glad you understand why you can't be with Flame Princess.  Bubblegum, I can't do this anymore! - What? - Now you like me?! Finn, what are you talking about? What am I talking about?!  PB, I was --  I was in love with you, okay?! And you didn't love me back. Now I'm ready to move on, and it's like  you're gonna build me up all over again. Well, I'm done! I'm done. Oh, no.  Bacon pancakes, making bacon pancakes Take some bacon, and I'll put it in a pancake Bacon pancakes, that's what it's gonna make Bacon panca-a-a-a-ke  Finn?! Jake, where's Finn? Is he with Flame Princess? Back off, Bubblegum. That's his man's biz. Is he with her or not?! You heartless monster. Do you have any idea how much he's cried over you?! Finn deserves to be happy! Even if his bloopin' face gets burned off! You should be ashamed! - You're sick! - What are you -- This isn't about some petty love triangle! Flame Princess is physically unstable! Her elemental matrix can't handle extreme romance. Glob, if Finn tries to kiss her, she'll burn so hot, she'll melt right through the planet's crust, down through the molten core. Then she'll be thrown back and forth by gravity until she burns out the world from the inside! Why do you think I had her father keep her locked up?!  Will you take me to them? Faster! FINN: Your wavelengths are my weakness. Your emissions are what I've been missing.  No. Aaah!  Flame Princess?! Flame Princess!  Finn! Finn, there's no time! You have to -- Are you all right? Finn!  Flame Princess!  It's hot! Wait. Wait! Don't move. This is good. If you stay on the hole for 24.8 seconds, the reaction will be deprived of oxygen. She'll go out.  What about Finn? Hey.  What's wrong? Please -- say something.  Please, I need you to be okay.  Huh?   Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm okay. She's stabilized. We're safe for now. Oh, Finn.  What? Jealous? Shut up.  


     JAKE: Ha! Here. Try throwing this one. Ugh!  Here's one called ''Caturday Surprise.'' Throw it! Ugh! PRlNCESS BUBBLEGUM: Yeah, go on! Get out of here! Unless you feel like a fist cookie, you better keep running! What the heck is going on? l have no idea, but it's probably best to stay out of it. Yeah. Hey, look. This one looks stupid. Let's see how it flies. Ugh! Aw, lame. Huh?  Uh-oh. PRlNCESS BUBBLEGUM: Duke of Nuts!! What have you done?! Ohh. Oh, no. She thinks that nuts guy did it. We got to go clear up what happened. Don't worry, my dear. l'll have you fixed up in no time. Princess? Are you okay? Yeah, l guess if green and bald is okay. Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, boy. l'm sorry. l can't stop now. My dear, not to worry. The medicine milk in this suit will have you healed lickety-split. ln just five days, you'll be back to your beautiful Bubblegummy self. Five days?! The grand meeting of Ooo Royalty is tonight!!  Ohh.  Uh, hey, Princess. There's something l should tell you about that bottle that hit you in the face. l already know, Finn. The Duke of Nuts has always been a bad guy. But now that he's done this, l'll never forgive him! And it's not just because l hate the Duke. l'd never forgive anybody who did thls to me. l'd hate them Yeah, but -- BUBBLEGUM: forever! Forever?! Finally, l have a witness to his misdeeds! Two witnesses. Jake! Oh, Finn, my flawless, flawless champion. Bring the Duke of Nuts to justice -- The justice of a cold dungeon!   She's completely bonkers. What do l do? lf l tell her l threw it, she'll hate me forever. Don't worry. That won't happen. We're gonna catch that Duke. But we're the ones who threw the bottle. Dude, look. The Duke of Nuts is bad guys. How do you know that? Think about it. lf Bubblegum hates him so much, then he must have done some rotten stuff. l mean, maybe he even threw a bottle and turned someone ugly before. Maybe you're right. Maybe l am. All right, then. Just this once, we'll be vigilantes! Nah, we're more like cops -- crooked cops.  Princess, l won't rest until the villainous Duke is captured! Oh, thank you, Finn.  Whoa, okay, and by then, hopefully you'll have taken care ofthis. Look yonder! The Duke of Nuts' castle. Duke of Nuts! How are you? By order of Princess -- um Princess  Hello, Finn. Are you here to arrest the Duke? How did you know? The Nuts told me. For l am the Duchess of Nuts.  Oh, should have asked if these were like her eggs or something. l know of my husband's crime against the Princess -- a crime that you personally witnessed! And why would you lie, huh? Yeah. Why? Oh, but he was once such a wonderful man. He pet dogs, kissed babies. We'd lie together underneath the cashew bush. He even taught underprivileged nuts how to dance. But somehow he's gone rancid! These nuts tell me he must be executed. Would you like to hear what my nuts have to say?! That won't be, um, necessary. Listen! Listen! Whoa! l don't get it, Jake. How can the dude be evil if he pets puppies, kisses babies, and lies with his wife? What?! You believe that? She is nuts. Listen, man. Let's just go back and face the music. Who cares if Bubblegum hates you forever? lt's no biggy. Tons of people hate me. Why, Jake? Why won't you print my letters? l-l-l hate you!! Hmm.  lt's him -- the Duke of Nuts!  l'll break left! You take the right! Ugh! l went left, too! Ooh! Wha? You're way smaller than l thought you were. Dude, that's not him. No one will harm the Duke of Nuts. l will kill whoever seeks to arrest him. No! Please! This has gone far enough. That's the Duke of Nuts. But l vowed to kill whoever did this to you. They can't take you away, Dad.  Who's the toughest little nut? That's you.  One second.  Man, l don't know, Jake. Why would Princess Bubblegum hate him if he was such a nice guy? Just because he's a good father doesn't necessarily mean he isn't a villain. That doesn't look like a villain. l could probably think of a reason why that's villainous if you gave me enough time. Maybe. - Ugh! Maybe we should just confess. But then Princess Bubblegum will hate us forever. Hey, man. lt's not that bad being hated. Come on! Pick it up! You son of a blee blob! Oh. Sorry to make you wait. l made these daisy crowns for you guys as a -- as a token of my gratitude for waiting. Ohh, sorry, l -- l have to sit down for a second. Oh. l know this is an odd question, but you wouldn't happen to have any pudding on you, would you? Actually, yeah, l think l have one in my pack. Oh. Oh, thank goodness. l think l have a spoon in here, too. What -- What happened to the cup? Oh, l'm so embarrassed. Now you know my shame. l can't stop eating pudding. What?! l don't tell people because l hate making them worry, but, yes, l have a rare condition, a pudding deficiency.  And l always end up eating all the royal pudding supply whenever l go to the castle. So that's why Princess Bubblegum hates you. Yes, but l didn't turn Princess Bubblegum green and bald. l would never do such a thing. Ugh! Of course you wouldn't. You're too nice a guy. l'm the one who threw that bottle. l was gonna tell her, but then she started talking all crazy. She said she'd never forgive me, and l didn't know. Hey, it's okay. People make mistakes. lt's all part of growing up. And you never really stop growing. Now you're making me feel even worse by being so nice about it. Maybe l should just confess the crime and end all this. Wait. l think l might have an idea that will save everyone's reputations. Halt! Finn! Did you find the Duke yet? Not yet. But you are in grave danger, Princess. There is an assassin in these very woods dead set on stopping you from reaching the grand meeting. ln fact, it's that rustling in the bush. Rustle, rustle, rustle. JAKE: l'm an ambush! Halt! What's going on?! Oh, did l come out too early?  What are you here to do, stranger? l've come for the Princess! l'm an assassin! Um, guys Stand back! l will stop him! Hyah! Hyah! Phew! l'll kill you and raise your children as my own!  Hyah!  H-a-a! Unh! Ugh! Remember, it's just acting, Jake. Sorry, dude. Ooh! Now, to kill you up! But wait! Surely this cannot be the fair Princess Bubblegum. Where are her pink, flush cheeks? The long, gooey hair? - Ugh! Oof! Clearly the princess travels elsewhere. Later, Bubblegum! Get out there, man! l don't know if l can do this. Go, go, go, go! And that's how l, the Duke of Nuts, by disfiguring you beyond all recognition, humbly saved your life. Yeah! All right! Yeah! What was the point of this little play again?  And why isn't the Duke clapped in irons? She's right. lnnocent or not, l should accept what's coming to me. Peppermint Butler. Oh, no. ''Nut'n's'' going my way today. Hup! Hup! Hup! - No! Finn? The Duke didn't throw that bottle. Ugh. Princess, l have something sucky to confess. l'm the one who threw the bottle.  l'm sorry. But l knew if l told you, you'd hate me forever. Hmm. Well l could never stay mad at you forever. And you seem genuinely penitent. l don't even know what that means, but thank you.  Yeah!  But that doesn't douse my hatred for the Duke! Yeah, what's up with that hate? That jerk always empties out my pudding pantry! Aw, shucks. He just can't control himself around pudding. He goes coconuts for it because he has a pudding deficiency. lt's true, your majesty. l -- l'm sorry for my medical condition. Oh, my. You poor man. Of course you're forgiven. Yeah, l don't believe a word from him.  l'm really sorry about making you temporarily ugly, Princess, especially before the Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty. l wish there was some way to make it up to you. Maybe there is, Finn. Maybe there is.  Hey! Hmm? What? You said ''Maybe.'' Call to order the sesquicentennial grand meeting of Ooo Royalty. l now call upon the delegate from the Candy Kingdom. Princess Bubblegums?  ''lt would be be presumptuous indeed to present myself against the distinguished Princess to whom you have listened.''  Buy a lady a drink?  The Marquis of Nuts?! Yes! But l didn't come alone! Remember me, Jake?! No. -  -

Heehee, not bad. And now for some healthy exercise.  I'm forgetting about that silly old break-up already.  All right, let's fly! Ohh! You fool, you can't fly without your beard. I'm going to be alone forever. Hi! ICE KING: Beautiful princess. Excuse me for approaching you, sir. You just seemed so approachable.  ICE KING: That's funny -- usually my looks put people off. ICE KING: Is someone paying you to do this?  Tell me about yourself. ICE KING: Well, there's not much to tell, really. I'm an ice king. Oh, a nice king. ICE KING:  No, no, dear, you misheard me. I'm not a nice king. I'm a  A really nice king.  And I'm single.  Oh, my gosh!  Yeah, guess what? Slime princess is in the park, and she's, like, talking to a new nice king.  And he's, like, totally single. By the way, don't tell anybody.  There's a new king in town. Oh, my goodness, I can't wait to meet him.  FINN:  And I was like, "leave him alone!" And he was like, "make me." And I was like, "okay." And then he was like, "agh, my head!"  Dude, what are you doing? JAKE: I'm just trying to get a signal. It's like everyone in ooo is on their phones or something. Oh, man! Ohh! Have you guys Seen the new Nice king? FINN: Nice king? Yeah He's single And he's ours! Now get out of our way! FINN: Agh!  JAKE: Man, now we got to kick that frog out of his new home. FINN: Nah. Let him keep it. Hey, if there's a new king and he's nice, we should offer our services. JAKE: Finn and Jake-style. Yoo-hoo! Nice king!  ICE KING: Ladies, I'll have time to meet you individually later. Please, just stop squirming. But this looks like a prison. ICE KING: Pris--  Don't be ridiculous. It's a waiting room. Stop squirming. BOTH: Nice king! Aaaah! ICE KING: Finn and Jake! You'll never take me alive! BOTH: Huh? FINN: You're the nice king, right? ICE KING: Oh, yeah. I keep forgetting that. FINN: Well, we will honor and serve you. ICE KING: Serve me? FINN: Yeah. We want to be your nice knights. ICE KING:  Uh, sounds Nice. With my rod of niceness, I dub thee two my nice knights. FINN: Yay! We're knights! BOTH: Nice! FINN: Who do you want us to nice-knights against? Nice king, I love you! Did I tell you that I like the opera? But if you don't, I hate it! ALL: Nice king ICE KING: Please! I'm trying to tell my nice knights something! Come here. The main enemy to the nice king right now is the disorganization of his love life. FINN: Well, what do you mean? ICE KING: The ugly ones are all mixed up with the other ones! I need you to catalog them or something. JAKE:  But we punch monsters. ICE KING: After I choose my bride, then you can go punch the monsters. FINN: Managing admirers? We'll give it a try. Let's move on to something easier. Um, do you like drums? Um, am I supposed to? JAKE: She's dodging the question. FINN: Are you fond of men with magical abilities? I'm really nervous right now. I just really want to meet a nice king. JAKE: You can go back to the waiting room now, ma'am! I screwed it up, didn't I?  JAKE: I think we did a good job. FINN: I don't feel good making a princess cry. This is not how knights are supposed to act. JAKE: Finn, knights are loyal to their king. FINN: I'm still not sure. JAKE: Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. Loyalty to the king. FINN: Can't argue with that. ICE KING: Hey, nice knights, turtle princess is about to walk out that door. I told her that I like her a lot, but I really don't like her all that much. Could you guys break it off for me? FINN: The nice king is not looking for a relationship right now. JAKE: Get out of here!  FINN: He's just not ready for a relationship! JAKE: All right! We did it, dude! FINN:  I feel terrible. I need to talk to the nice king about this. ICE KING: Yes, yes, keep walking in a circle.  FINN: Nice king, may I speak with you for a moment? ICE KING: Princesses, I must speak to my knight in private. Go on, back into your cage. BOTH: Bye, nice king! ICE KING: What's up, knight? FINN: I don't like treating princesses this way. I don't want to -- I don't want to do this anymore. ICE KING: Your loyalty is in question? FINN: It's not that. It's just, princesses are supposed to be treated with niceness. ICE KING: Are you implying that I'm not the nice king? FINN: What's wrong with you?! ICE KING:  Hey, I'm here! ICE KING: Ugh!  Finn, get rid of her. FINN: What?! No, man! ICE KING: She's too loud and lumpy. I like smooth princesses -- smooth. I can be smooth. Finn, punch out my lumps. FINN: What?! I can be whatever he wants. I can change! FINN: I can't punch a princess! ICE KING: Oh! Finn, just punch her! Let me see what she looks like smooth. FINN:  Yes! Hit me, hit me, hit me! FINN:  I'm sorry, lumpy space princess. I just can't punch you. Are you serious? Fine. I'll do it myself.  FINN: Princess, no! ICE KING: Wait a minute, nice knight. Let's see what she can do. There. How's that? Better? ICE KING: Eh. No, I don't like her. This is all your fault, Finn!  FINN: King, I'm sorry -- I just can't do this anymore. Punching princesses, breaking hearts -- it doesn't seem nice at all. ICE KING: Hey! You're on thin ice, nice knight! Huh? FINN: Huh. ICE KING:  The jig is up! FINN: What jig? ICE KING: Uh  My jig is up -- up high. It's a highland jig. I have a new assignment for you, one with more knight-related stuff -- very important. FINN: Oh, wow! Awesome! What is it? ICE KING: The ice king stole my razor. Sneak into his trap-filled ice castle and retrieve it. And don't look through the shoe box that he keeps behind the laundry bag in the closet. FINN: Wha? ICE KING: Those are my orders!

FINN:  You look just like the ice king. And so do I. JAKE:  These whiskers would make anyone look like the ice king. FINN:  Yeah, even the nice king.  The nice king is the ice king! ICE KING: Ugh. What do those princesses see in this face? Hope I can keep this going. So many princesses to meet. Whiskers! I can't be growing whiskers now!  I haven't picked who I want to marry me! FINN: Nice king! ICE KING: Did you retrieve my stolen razor? FINN: Yeah, and also This! ICE KING: My beard! Uh, I mean, what is that? JAKE:  He knows what it is. FINN: Let's get him, Jake! Stop!

This is my alter-ego Davey Johnson. Ohhhhhhhh. I'll dress up like this so nobody bothers me about being Finn. Do you think that'll going to do the trick? I dunno.  Huh? Huh? Is that? Is that Finn?! Hello um  Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello. He-llo. Uhhhhhhhhh Hello. I'm Davey. Oh. Thought it was Finn, on account he's wearing Finn's exact clothes. Oh, man. Ha ha! Hi. I'm Davey. Ah, so what?

That must be him.  I made you dinner, Finn! Where were you?! ALL: Whoa! Uh, what's going on? Oh, hiya, mister. Thanks for putting me up last night. I'm just chopping some wood so's I can build a little log cabin to live in. Huhhhhhh?! Hey. I'm Randy. Randy, want to get dinner tonight? Nah. I'm busy. I like to wander at night. Finn, what's going on? You got to start calling me "Davey," Mister because that's my name. Da-a-a-a-a-vey. Aw, no! Have you lost your teacups, man? Mister, I don't know nothing about that. I'm just a working Joe, trying to stake my claim under the sun and look out on the beautiful green fields called life! Uhhhhh RAND Y: Hey, Davey, where do you want these logs? Oh, just attach them to the cabin, like how it should be so it looks like a cabin. We're gonna build a right wall and a front wall. Uh how about the roof? Maybe. Maybe. I've been holding these.

I'll cut you! I mean, rob you! Oh, no! I'm a robber! I'm gonna rob this guy's life! And there's nobody who can stop me! Unless there's a hero around here.

Put on your awesome hat and beat me up! What? I'm not talking to you, Randy! I called the police. Hmm. Wait what?! BOTH: Weee-oooh! Weee-oooh! Guys, it's not what it looks like!

But remember that time when Davey sat in the park and saw some people walking around?  Yeah. That was nice. And remember that time when Davey swept the floors?  Yeah, that was great, too. But Do you really want to go back to being a famous hero? Why not just be Davey A simple man with simple goals and simple problems? You can just blend in and live the simple life. Yeah blend in.

The lake guarded by evil Lake Knights? Yeah, l can't remember why l threw it in there. Let's all go and get it! Whoa, Jake! You're inviting Rainicorn?

All right!  Yeah! Lady, you are incredible! You should adventure with us all the time! Heh, heh, heh. All according to plan.  Uh, what? Here's the translator. Let's see here.

And that's the end of my story.  Well, at least with old man option, we can understand him. l mean, her! l mean you, sugar. Hop on my back, and l'll give you both a ride home.  Whatever you say, grandpa. Rah! Come on, my darling. Wrap your legs around me.  l remember why l drowned that translator now. Hey, grandpa, how are you able to fly if you don't have wings? Well, light travels from the sun, then bounces off of our planet and back into our eyes so we can perceive color. Whoa! My body can intercept that light and dance around on it.

Let's go enjoy this dream before we wake up.  Dream, dr-dream Dream, dream, dream, dream Dreamy dream  Whoa!  Dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams  Hey, man, I don't think this is a dream.  Dream, dream, dream  Hmm? Oh. Well, then it's time to get real. Help! Somebody help! Help! Help me! Help me! The monster ate somebody! We have to go inside his guts! Ugh! Monster guts! Who-o-o-o-a! Ugh! Ugh! Help! Somebody help! Hyup! Eee! Ugh! Oh! It's gross! Help! Come on! Help! Help me Hang these streamers! What?! It's not a party without streamers!  Doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo  Dude! This isn't a party! We got to get you out of here. Hey! Jake, help me! It's starting! These crazy bears don't know they're in danger! Well, we should go. Jake, wait! We have to help them. They're partying. They're fine. Okay, Jake. What happens when you eat food? Well, it goes into your stomach. Ye-e-e-e-ah? And then it stays there for a bit. And then it turns into -- They're all gonna turn into the stuff! Hey, excuse me. Excuse me. I don't know why you don't know this, but y'all are partyin' in a monster's stomach. Thanks! I love dancing! No! Y'all Are partyin' In a monster's stomach! I think he wants to know where the bathroom is! It's over there! Hey! I'm Cubby. Hi, Cubby. What's going on? I heard what you said About this being a monster's belly. I've been telling everyone that for three days! Why won't they listen? 'Cause I'm just a kid! Cubby! Are you bothering these guys with your fantasy stories? No! I wasn't! I swear! I'm dancing. See? See?! Hmm. Cubby, is there anything we can do to help? You could talk to Party Pat. "Party Pat"? He's our Chief. If you can convince him to leave, all will follow. Can you take us to him? Sure! He sleeps on the monster's heart. It's like a blood water bed. This is as far as I go. Party Pat is right around this corner. Bye, you guys! Bye, Cubby! Bye! Uh We're looking for Party Pat? Oh. Uh Well, listen, I know you don't know us, sir, but we need to talk. It's pretty important, actually. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. You know who I am? You'reParty Pat? I'm the Chief. Ri-i-i-i-ght. Right. You're the Chief. Shh. Before you talk to the Chief you must party with the Chief. But -- It is the only way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah So turn up the music, and we'll never leave Better believe We'll never run from the fun, because we're Bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears be-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ars!  Dude, we've been partying for hours. Yeah. He keeps drinking those honey-flavored energy drinks! How's your nausea? Full-blown. Hang in there, pal. Hey, Party Pat. You're the Chief, and I totes respect that. But what we have to tell you is really important. And you said if we partied, we could talk. But you haven't been partying. What?! You move to music, but that's not dancing. You chew pancakes, but you're not tasting. To truly party, one must leave behind the problems that are troubling and open one's mind eye. I'm just kiddin'. You guys are party animals. This is just a sticker. You can stay in our cave as long as you want. That's what I've been trying to tell you, man! This isn't a cave! Y'all are partyin' in a monster's belly! Oh, yeah. That makes sense. It's definitely the weirdest cave I've ever seen. So you'll tell everyone to leave? Nah, we love it here. But you're all gonna die if you stay! Attention. Attention, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? Soapparently we're not in a cave. - We're not in a cave? - What did he say? I always thought we were in a cave. We're in a monster's belly! It's kind of peaceful. All those bears are gonna turn into the stuff. Shh! Seriously, the only foreseeable threat might be all these trees being swallowed. But they're not hurtin' nothin'. Yeah. Good thing he isn't swallowing some deadly volcano lava. That would kill them for sure. Whoa! The monster's headed toward that volcano! Uh-huh. We got to warn the bears! If we bum everyone out, maybe they'll listen to us. Oh. Okay. Just follow my lead.  My hot dog's dead My pizza's dead My cupcake is dead  Oh. Uh.  My donut's dead My burger's dead My milkshake is dead All of our favorite foods are totally dead They cannot procreate in little food beds We'll eat them up And turn them into stuff And we'll cry over their graves But you can't cry enough When you miss someone you love, you can't cry enough  You bears got to get out of here, or you're all gonna be melted by lava! Party Pat, do you know of another exit? Well, there's the dark and mysterious mine, but nobody uses it anymore. He must be talking about the butt intestines. Come on, Jake! We got to get out of here! One more bandage. Huzzah! The party bears are safe, Party Pat! Y'all can party out here now. No. To survive, my people need a phat party club to grind in. That monster's gut was totally excellent. You're sick, Party Pat. I'm gonna go watch TV. Hmm. Pat, he's not gonna let you back in his mouth. You scorched it all up with fireworks! Unless Party Pat! Party Pancakes. Hear me, monster. My people and I wish to party inside you once more! Prithee, take us upon thine gut, and we shall party no more with fireworks, but instead with gentle lasers! Hey, Jake, wait up!

But I don't want you walking all that way. Okay, you ready for a motorbike ride? Mm-hmm!  Okay. Now we're talkin'. She just needs a little love.  Wowzers! Okay, let's try something else.

I can fight! I'm sorry, Marcy. Simon!  You have to keep it together, Simon for her. Simon, you promised.

     MAN: No-o-o-o-o-o-o! Get away from me, you butchers! Starchy, you have a cold. The cure is right here. Just let me No! Starchy only takes magic! Oh, come on.  Find me a wizard! Nurse Poundcake, hold Starchy while I administer the serum. -  - What? Look, I'm a nurse and all, but my uncle is a magic worker, and he cured my sadness about my marriage.  Listen, all magic is is scientific principles presented like mystical hoo-doo, which is fun but it's sort of irresponsible. I got your magic right here, okay? And razzle dazzle! Flooby-doo! Zamabamafoo! Is that a real spell? No, I'm making fun of spells. Princess, you're being really disrespectful of my beliefs. That was very close-minded!  Starchy, I just want to help.  All right! You want me to go to Wizard City and get you a cold spell? You still think I'm a jerk? All right, sit tight. - How is he? - He's still sick.  - Yo, that stinks! Tonight's part 3 of his graveyard secrets workshop. Yeah, Prubs, give him the medicon. He won't take it. He wants me to get him a cold spell from Wizard City. - BOTH: Oh, okay. - That makes sense.  Dude, you guys! Really? Yeah, I mean, magic's probably more natchy for your body in the long run.  Have you two been to Wizard City? Nope. "Wizards only." Wizards don't play. Trespassers get killed mad quick, like zap-zap. Well, then what? Let's stay home. Just kidding. All right, meet me outside of Wizard City in your freshest wizard johns.  H-Hurry, Princess. FINN: This is it? Yeah, man, this is it. Well, what's with the wall? Wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-op! What's over there? Nothing. Just more mountains. I think the wall knows we're not wizards. But we can trick it, right? How do you trick a wall? Don't know, man. I give up. For reals? Yeah, I'm no good at this! Unh! Oof! That was a nice try, man. Guys, hold up! I got the password from The Ice King. Apparently, the barrier only responds to the voice of real wizards. ICE KING: No way! I'm no rat! I am bound by the sacred trust of esoteric knowledge! BUBBLEGUM: Say the password, Ice King! ICE KING: You think I'll just hand you the keys to the city? I'd rather die. BUBBLEGUM: Say the password. ICE KING: Ow! My pinky! Ow.  Thank you. You know, no one has touched me in months. Could you touch me again? BUBBLEGUM: Password! Now! ICE KING: Ow! Ohh! Ohh! "Wizards Rule!" The password is "wizards rule!" Aah Whoa. Powerful magicks. Pshh! It's a vocal registry rigged to a vibration modulator. The wall's still there. It's just the density's all wobbled. Boo. Um that's what it is, Jake. All right, what am I, then? This don't look like magic to you? It looks like a mutation. Boring. Yeah, right. Just 'cause I know my shnoz Look at these dopes. Half of these spells are all working on entanglement principles. "Entanglement" is a spell where you get trapped in tree roots, and sometimes they spike out and hook your flesh, and you got to be like, "My body is clay. My spirit feels no pain." Then you chop your way out and kill the wizard! That's not what I meant, but whatevs. Where's this magic shop? These signs are weird. Let's ask somebody. Hey, dudes. Yo, where's the Stand back, citizen. Yeesh. Okay. Who are these guys? BUBBLEGUM: They're like the city popo or something. Stranson Doughblow, you are guilty of impersonating a wizard, as well as purchasing magic items from Ron James' Spell Palace. Bingo. Wait! I know some coin tricks. The sentence is Whoa! - Oh, my shrah! - Come on. You saw that, right?  Welcome, brothers! Sorry about that biz outside. Ha ha ha! Oh, what a silly non-magic user, right? All right, bros. Ronny James got mad spells for wizards of all E.X. P.S. No need for memorization, incantation, or hard-to-find bularoo. Just rip one of these babies open, and you'll be like, "Ta-da!" We got a bottle-returns program and all that shwazaa. So, wha-za? We need a spell for the cold. Heck, yeah, brah. I got something. Whoof! This baby right here right here? This is what you want, brothers. - How's it work? - It works by magic. It's a spell. - Dude What? I'm curious. So, what's in it? It's my secret brew, dog. So you want to sell me a product with no information? It's a cold spell. Made from what? Magic. What's the magic made out of, dingdong? - Y'all is fakes! - FINN: No, wait! Bam!  You're busted! Yoink! Aah! Dang. - Hey, Jake? - What? Is P. B. Straight-up naked right now? JAKE: Dude, don't make me feel any more awkward than I already do! Dang! It's a dead end!  - BOTH: Abracadaniel! - Huh? Do I know you? Dude, it's me Finn! Quick, let us in! Oh, guys, I don't know. That's not my place. I just work here and I - Please! - Come on, man! - Shush! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Shoop! MAN: Yeah, when the lamb comes back, laser wizard puts him on the altar. And then I extract his forehead, right, Bufo? Ooh. Right, yeah. That's the plan  What the blutt, Abracadaniel?! What part of "Secret Society" don't you understand?! Whoa, whoa, whoa! We don't want trouble! Just let us rest for a bit. Oh, we gonna put you to rest for good!  You are guilty of harboring non-magic users! - Barrier! - We need an exit!  Oh, boy. That's what you get for asking a magician about his tricks, P. B.! TOGETHER: Ghosts of the Warp Plane, grant us passage into your realm. Hey, guys, wait for me! Shush! Whoa! Receive your just punishment! No! As ruler of the Candy Kingdom, I demand parley with the Grand Master Wizard! MAN: Princess Bubblegum! For shame. And I'm very disappointed in you, Abracadaniel. However, Princess, since you have always been a dear friend to the wizard community, just say "wizards rule" and you're all free to go. Wha? Really? Mmm? - Psst! Wizards rule! - No!  Oh! All magic is science! You just don't know what you're doing, so you call it magic! And, well, it's ridiculous. Wizard prison! All of you! N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! JAKE: Ridiculous, huh? This isn't happening! - Ho! - Ouch! Would you look at that? Somebody better start crying into my hand. Ugh! That's sick! PRISONER: You're right. I'm so ashamed. Ugh! Ouch! Come on! Move it! You two in here! I got cells upstairs for Princess and Milkface.  I got traumatized by those underpanties. This sucks. Hey, let's count the days. One. Hey, P. B., are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. JAKE: Sleep tight, Princess! Good night. Stupid wizards JAKE: Two! P. B.! Over here! Unh! Whoa! Bubblegum, I hereby challenge you to an honorable prison stabbing to the death! Bring it on. What?! Are you two crazy?! I've had it with you silly wizards! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Jake, we have to do something.  - Raaah! We need to get out of this. Yeah, we still got to heal the snuffins out of Starchy with this little baby here. All this for a cold spell. What the ice? Hmm. MAN: Hey, Milkface isn't dead. Strike me down and restore my honor. No! Sorry, but you have to kill him. Otherwise, we'll kill all of yous two both. - Peebs! Incoming! - What? It's a cold spell, not a cold spell. Prisoner, drop that contraband magic! - Whoa! - Get down! Your magicks are powerful, P. B. Okay. Let's get out of here. Poor Starchy. All that trouble and we couldn't get any magic for him. Hmm. I've got an idea.  Woo-oo-oo-oo! Eh? Finally! Healing magic. Oh, I can feel it! No! Rubel-dubel dingel-dongel pffrt!

I've injected you with half the poison, and you'll be dead in 30 minutes, unless you kill the Princess, which is when I'll give you the antidote. Finn! Help me! What's wrong?

     What's her condition, Dr. Ice Cream? She's totally gross over The other 10% is crazy nasty. Will she make it, Doctor? I don't know, Nurse Poundcake.  Put sugar on her! Two scoops!  We're losing her! No! Not my number one! Princess, if you die on me, I will never forgive you! I'll be lost, lost in my own emotional labyrinth. Yaah! Wait, Finn. What? Her sugar levels are stabilizing!  Yes, I'm fine. I just need to rest.  My wife. Is there anything weird about her? I can't see through these pain tears. She's fine. Why? It's just that, after Princess fell into the well, I saw something strange happen, something I still don't understand. Whoa! Daah! Wait! Listen to me! No! Just shut your face, old man! "Old man"?  What? I'm not old. Uh, yeah you are, dude. Yeah. You're pretty old. You are. "Old"? I'm I see. It's all making sense now. Br-r-r-r-appa-po! I'm going, Princess. I'm sorry if my skin grossed you out. Nobody wants to see this old skin, I guess. Nobody in the world. Just get out of here! Peace.  Sorry about that, Peebles. The ice wizard is a weak fool. Huh? Finn! Finn! The other Princesses and I made you a new backpack. Whoa, Raggedy Princess! It's so awesome! Thank you! You're welcome, Finn.  You look like sick gray meat. But we're gonna jack you up so awesome. FINN: We should wheel her to her bedroom, right? JAKE: Yeah, man, and then we'll do magic tricks. FINN: Like fake magic? JAKE: Yeah, like "Bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh! It was there the whole time!" BOTH: Princess? Princess? Surprise! We picked every flower in the Candy Kingdom just for you! Whoo-ooh! Princess Bubblegum?  Oh, geez! What's wrong with Princess Bubblegum?! Quiet, dude! We're supposed to take care of her, not make her feel bad. I know, man, but she just seems We-e-e-e-ird. She's just messed up from the accident, man. We just have to take care of her till she feels better. Uh Okay, dude. Princess! Princess, no! You shouldn't be out of bed! Princess I I got to tell you somethin'. Uh Jake? Oh! Gotcha. I'll go get some tea. Princess, the sweater you made me kept me safe. I almost got super messed-up, but it saved me. And I wanted to say Thank you for imbuing the sweater with the power of liking someone a lot. 'Cause I like you a lot.  Um, we shouldn't talk about this now. You should rest. Finn, I need you to get me some things. Yes, Princess. Princess, I brought you some tea.  Whoa. Somethin' weird's goin' on. - Jake. - Aah! I'm gonna get some stuff for PB. Be right back. Hey, Princess, sorry you're not feeling good. Oh! I'll sing you a song! You love it when I sing songs. Princess, you're not feelin' good You're not feelin' like a Princess should And if you want to get better fast, check out my cute little booty dance  Uh Aw, this song's not that good. It's a bad one. I-I'm stopping.  And starting a new song!  Jake.  Oh, my gob! Oh, my gob! Oh, my gob! Oh, my gob! Maybe the toxic waste did something to her brain, made her have demon powers or something! Yo, dude. Wait! What's all that biz? Uh Bleach, lighter fluid, ammonia, gasoline, I don't know -- lady stuff. Plutonium -- No, man! No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Thanks. No probs! Wait! Hold on! What's up? Listen, PB's bed was on fire. What?! Is she okay?! She made it on fire! With a match? No, man! With her brain, I think. Look, man! I'll show you! Jake, wha-- Shh! P-p-princess? Over there.  PB? You in there? I'm busy! See? It's fine. She's just havin' private time. I'm lookin' in! Jake, what the hey?! Oh, my gloob! Come on, man! That's pervy! You don't even know, man! Dude! Look! See it? Hold on, proibles!  Princess! Whoa! Put down the tub!  Oh! Evil presence detected. Must defend! ICE KING: Hey, Finn. - Are you dead or what? - Wha? Ice King, what are you doing here? Hey. I had to keep an eye on the Princess, because she is being possessed by the Lich. Unh! You don't know that! But I do! I saw it with my wizard eyes! In the well, I saw something come out of the lich and go into the Princess! But I wasn't sure it was real, because when you have stanky old wizard eyes, sometimes you see things that are real, and other times it's like "crazy crazy crazy" in your face all the time.  All the time. Guys, let me help you. I don't want my future wife to be  physically unattractive. Listen, you old poot! I'm not going to let you kill her twice! Get stuffed! Come on, Jake!  Oh. We're coming, Princess! Dude, I think we should let the Ice King help. He could freeze her! Which could buy us some ti-- Dump that mess! I'm-a set her free with my like-like sweater! Whoado it!  I like you, Princess! Ooh! Waaaaah! Finn!  Liking her didn't work. She's unstoppable. Unless  Ow! Ow! Ow! Gaah. Ice King, I I need you to freeze Princess Bubblegum. Will you help me?  Are you su-u-u-u-re? Yes. Great! Whee!  I'll distract her up top. You freeze her legs!  I'm a cat! I'm an agile cat! Blehhh! Jake, duck! Meow, Ice King! Thanks, bird!  Yeah! Whoopie! You did good, Ice King. Oh, yeah? Yeah, man. Okay. I didn't kill her this time. Everybody saw that, right? Dude. We got to get her to the hospital! Start assembling! Here. Try to connect these two pieces. Turn it. Perfect. Give me more pieces, Dr. Princess. That's all we have, Dr. Ice Cream. What? That can't be.  What do we do, doctor? I don't know, nurse Poundcake.  I hope she's okay. Attention, everyone. Is PB okay?! Yes. But there were some complications. No-o-o-o! Yes. I'm afraid there wasn't enough gum to work with. So, it appears Princess Bubblegum is now younger.  She's 13 years old now. Aw, dang it! Well, I'm out of here. Goodbye, everyone. Well, that's how old I am. Uh Ohhh! Give me a hug, hero.  


    Dude! Shooting star! Make a wish! FINN:  That's not a shooting star. It's just a firefly. What are you gonna wish for, dude? Oh, you know that something special only two bros can share. I think I'm wishing for the same thing! You mean the Ancient psychic tandem war elephant!  Oh, man! I want to ride it so bad! How do you even control those things? You can't control it, dude. You have to let it give you control. Oh, wow! Start wishing! What the?!  That's a distress flare from my other hot dog knights! I sent them to rescue my other other hot dog knights who got trapped in a labyrinth! Their message says "Baby Us Trouble Time." They must be in great danger! Hot dog knights are slow.  Don't worry, Princess. Jake and I are on it. Whoa. Fudge, man. This place is yoga balls huge!  Yoga balls aren't that really huge, dude. Hey, man, I can't analyze everything that comes out of my mouth. Should we, like, try to cheat and stretch over the walls? Naw, man. Look. Okay, well, then I'll just hook my legs around this stump and stretch us through so we don't get lost. Like this. See?  You're a cool guy, Jake. Thank you. Man! There's so many passageways and stuff. It'll take us forever to find those hot dog kni-i-i-i-ghts.  Don't eat me, man! Naw, we're here to save you, guy. Oh, thank the stars. We were lost. How didn't you guys get lost? We're just gonna follow Jake's body back. Ooh! Whoa! Far out! Aw, look at that! - That's great. At the center of the maze, there's a magic creature that grants wishes. "Wishes"?! Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Ancient psychic tandem war elephant! This is our chance! Hot dog! Hold on, boys! We're gonna get us some wishes!  Choo-choo! Choo-choo!  Sing, 'cause your mama, your mama, your mama said She said your mama, your mama, your mama what? Whatcha mama say? She say I'm busy making babies, greasy babies sliding on my gravies in the  Uh, I forgot the next part. Dang, Jake! Your body's getting thin! Hey I got a nice bod. Yeah but right now? Uh not so nice. Okay, well, you can take your weird body issues and tuck them somewhere private. Whereas I can take my healthy body issues and --  fight a golem!  Trespassers! Huh! Wrap him up, Jake! I'm on it! Stop flexing! I can'tstretchanymore! You can do it, Jake! Stretch, stretch, stretch! Wrap him up more!  Come on, baby! Yeah! Golemtaken care of Dudes. Jake, you're amazing!  Jake, you need to take it easy on the stretching, man. What?! N-no Jake. You can keep going, man! Right, guys! Come on, Jake! You can go! Jake! Jake! Jake! All right. Come on, Finn. The stretchy train is leaving the station. Choo-choo. Hmm.  Just got to keep stretching! Uh yeah. Wait! Stop, Jake. You hear that? - No. - This place is weirding me out. Keep your eyes open for traps and junk. Whoa. Check that out. Oh, snap! That's you, dude! Hmm. - Boop. Hey, man, watch it. I think that's my nerp, but, like, super stretched out. Boop, boop! Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boop!  Stop, man! Phoo! Nerp!  Oh, my grob! It's okay! Hot dogs are immune to poison! FINN: - Sick! - I got it! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Jake! Jake! Jake!  I'm good, man. It's the small scorpions you got to worry about. Or is that just with snakes? Ooh, nope. Wait. Poison's kicking in.  No, Jake! No! Hang in there, Jake. Work through the pain! Let's get wishes! ALL: Wishes! All right, you guys. Hop on. Let's do it. I don't think this is a good idea, man. I'm fine, brother. We'll have that war elephant in no time. Uhuh okay. Whoa! Hmm. Looks like the final puzzle. You think you can stretch up there, buddy? - Yes. - Whoa! Jake, you okay?! Uh, yeah. I just can't close my eyes. Lidstoo tight. Okay, dude, this is too far! No more maze. We're going home. Yeah. I'm feeling a little thin. Don't stop! Take it to max! Max it! - You stretch good! Jake! Jake! Jake! Whoo! Uhall right. Jake, no! You're gonna get hurt! - Go harder! - Go stronger! I'm going for it! Jake, no. Jake! Jake! Jake!  Done. That must be the wishes! Ki-i-i-i-tty You did it, man. Now we can go wish for our Ancient psychic tandem war elephant. Got to move carefully. My internal organs are super stretched paper thin. I love kitties. - Wha? - I am sorry! Aah! Jake! My insides are all mashed up. I knew we should have turned back! You were right. I pushed myself too far. I'll never fall victim to peer pressure again. No.. Jake! Jake! Jake! Actually, I'll do anything you guys want if you say my name three times.  Just hang tight, buddy. I'll use my wish to save you. Congratulations, warriors. Step forward and take your wishes! Ah! I'm gonna wish for a hat! Whoo! Who's next? Mnh-mnh. That floor got traps. Jake should stretch us across! - Jake! Jake! Jake! Here we go!  No! Jake is all jacked up! But how else can we get wishes?  Jake, get up and carry us across! But I'm too weak! Jake! Jake! Jake!  Yeah! Jake! Jake! Yeah! That's it. I'm dead.  Jake! Stay with me, man! - Nah. - But we did it, okay? I can wish you out of here, man! Oh, yes. Now you may each receive your wish for real. But be warned. There are no do-overs. Okay, so you guys should wish to get your buddies back, right? I wish for a box! Sweet! I wish to blow up! I mean like "get big." Wow. You guys are really stupid. What do you mean? Dog, you're next. What do you wish? Huh? Jake, wish for the ancient psychic tandem war elephant! Then I'll wish to save you! Right. It's so hard to think on an empty stomach. I wish I wasn't so hungry. You wasted your wish, man! I know. You should wish for the ancient psychic tandem war elephant. It's what we wanted. That's crazy, man. I gotta save your life! Do it forme. I wish for the ancient psychic tandem war elephant. Yes! Your wish is granted. Wha?!  It has to give you control! Remember! I'm on it! Ancient psychic tandem war elephant, hear me! Finn the human, are you worthy to command me?  You know I am, because you're psychic! Now wish for my friends to be healed! I wish for what Finn desires! Yeah, boy! No! You weren't supposed to have your wishes come true! You were supposed to die! Now bust us out of here. No! FINN: Yeah, boy!   This party is so crazy!


  Hee hee hee hee. Oh, man, these things are gonna make me rich. It's like a big yarmulke for the tummy. Mm. I think I'll keep this one for myself. Hoyt coiture! Hmm. Nice. Ooh, little roomy. When did that happen? I am wasting away. I should probably go polish off that cheesecake in the fridge. Hmm. Oh. Now, what are you guys up to? Ah, here's my man, Gunther. You're hanging with a bad crowd, Goontz. All right, guys, just let me rescue my cheesecake and my Goontz. Come on. Oh, there you are. A little Gunther, a little cheesecake And a little fork. You know what, Goonty? I am gonna take my time with this delicious cake. Take it real slow. Mmm. Oh, getting full. All right, maybe just another teeny corner. Mmm. What's wrong, Gunther? Does Gunther want some cheesecake, too? No. Cheesecake is not for penguins, silly Gunther. No, no. You win this round, Mr. cheesecake. I'll just clean up a few crumbs and leave the rest for tomorrow. I've had enough for one day. Gunther! Oh, my little pal. Gunther, I love _ _ That's so true. I am the prettiest one here. Come on, number 5! Five on number 5 to win! I feel lucky! Come on, number 5! What? I've got a lot of money riding on you to win, you jerk! Come on, you slug! Ugly, dumb walrus! Aah! What did I do to deserve this?! Gunther! Gunther, help! I'm your guest of honor! Gunther, help! I'm a princess, dummy! Get your mouth off me! Gunther. Don't touch my stomach. Ahhhh. The signal! The signal! We haven't had a communication from Orgalorg in thousands of years! He must be mad at us! Everybody kneel! Everybody kneel! Better do as he says, kids. Mommy, who's Orgalorg? Oh, well, uh Um to be honest, we thought he was just a myth our stupid grandparents told us so we wouldn't make out. Yes. And you should have listened. The elders. Yes, the elders. The elders! We told you Orgalorg is real and horrifying. But nobody would listen. You all just wanted to make out. Uh, well, we're listening now. After you had kids and they didn't want to listen to you, how did that make you feel? - Terrible. - Exactly. Anyway, so, make-outs. Orgalorg. Oh. Orgalorg. Orgalorg is an ancient cosmic entity who ruled the solar system with his cruel and deadly whims. The Breaker of Worlds. He was seeking ever more power. He desired to intercept a catalyst comet and absorb its essence. Thereby did he offend the king of Mars, who decreed that Orgalorg should be cast down. And yes, he was cast down by the flaming sword of Grob Gob Glob Grod. Orgalorg was banished to an inhospitable planet, where he would forget everything. Yea, even forget his identity and from whence he came. And the prophets say that the gravity of the planet did crush and compress Orgalorg into a more powerless and cuddlesome form. Ooh! But now he's back, and whose fault is that? Make-outs. Behold! It is he! Orgalorg reaches out from the void! Huh? Gunther? Gunther! That's a bad boy, Gunther. You wrecked daddy's stuff again. Son, your stuffing's peeking out. Okay, Gunther, let's just Boop. Beep. Bip. Bop. And a bandage. See? You're practically back to normal, my little Goontz. Here, take a look for yourself. Not bad, eh, Goonty? Not bad at all.


1       BMO, I've been playing this 72 hours straight.  Can I please save after this battle?  No, it takes up too much brain space.  I'm out of candles. Huh?!  Man, if Finn were here, we'd be doing this in shifts.  Oh, well, let's keep grinding.  I cannot talk and run this game at the same time.  Nooooo!  Well, I guess that means I'm free.  I live again!  My name is Jake, and I love my life Kissin' on lady 'cause she's basically my wife Fixin' up NEPTR 'cause he fell from a tree Catchin' up with Maja and A.P.T.W.E. Maja's in a coma, and she might not wake up I'm glad you got a friend now, even though that's messed up Take TV to the market to get him into fruits Take a little nappy in my blanket cocoon Wake up really early just to cook for my friends Later in the field at night, I thought I saw death Made myself a boat, and I sailed with a whale Took TV to the market so he could try kale and some other stuff Ahh.  Nice song, Jake.  What a crazy two weeks.  I think I'm ready to hole up  and go round two on "Age of Grinders."  But where's Finn? I need him on this adventure.  Uh, well  Hold on. What?  If you don't know, I'm not sure it's my business to tell you.  Don't you dare, Shelby! Give up that greasy gossip!  Word on the street is Finn's been hangin' with a new lady.  Who the honk is it?  I don't muscle princess. It's perfect.  I don't Me-Mow from the future! Nobody knows.  Finn's been keeping this on the super D.L.  Why?  He's just trying to be careful this time.  Oh, yeah, I get it.  But I still got to know who this girl is.  Okay, just don't blow up his spot.  I won't!  Ooh! Ohh!  Hey, Jake. Oh, hey, science cat.  Where's sword shark?  He died of old age.  Hey, are you gonna find out who Finn's girlfriend is?  Who told you that?  Word gets around, man.  Not to me, apparently.  Let me know the dirt when you find out.  I won't!  Huh? What's that?  Sounds like a flute coming from above the canopy.  Huntress Wizard!  Stop.  This isn't working, Finn.  Dude. Oh, hi, Jake. What are you doing here?  I wanted to check out your new lady friend,  but I guess she just dumped you like a diaper in the dirt, bro. I'm sorry, man. I want you to have a healthy relationship with someone cool.  That's so sweet, Jake. I love you, man.  Me, too, man.  Okay. I'm okay.  But, dude, me and Huntress Wizard weren't together.  We're just trying to conjure up the spirit of the forest  with my flute spell.  What the blood are you talking about?  It went down like this.  I was just minding my own business  in my new alone place I've been hanging out at.    Hello.  How are you playing like that?  I don't know. I'm just making stuff up.  Something in your notes has the quality  of a powerful evocation spell.  What spirit guides your hands?  Tell me, or I'll put this up your nose.  First off, I'm a great fighter.  And I'm especially agile when I'm nude, so good luck.  Second, my flute improv ain't no secret.  I let my grass hand do whatever it wants,  which is usually sort of shreddy and busy.  Let me see that hand.  You're what I've been looking for.  Lookin' for a dope boyfriend.  No, man, she thinks my grass arm flute playing  could summon the spirit of the forest.  I've been playing different songs for two weeks, though,  and he hasn't shown up yet.  Who's that, her ex-boyfriend?  Uh, I guess they used to hang out  but maybe in some kind of mentor-student capacity.  So my theory holds. You can still make this happen.  Yeah, I really want to help her summon this dude.  Finn, that's not why you're here.  That's why I'm here.  Come on, let's make some magic happen.  Yeah, my magic flute spell.  Ohh! Finn.  I had an idea.  Hi.  I think the problem is your flute.  We should make you a better one from a magical tusk.  Like the tusk of the legendary thunderboar  that lives in these woods.  I'm down for whatever if it helps.  I'm also here.  Hey, what's up?  It's late.  Why don't you guys crash at my place tonight?  We'll start the hunt first thing in the morning.  Ha-ha! I'm like your sleepover chaperone.  Grow up. You grow up, you teen!  So, yeah, here's the place.  We got some nice soft dirt right over here.  Pantry, in case you want a snack, bathroom.  I got a console if you get bored,  but it was a gift, so I haven't really set it up yet.  Night, boys.  Jake: Dude, I think I figured it out.  You can't summon the spirit of the forest  'cause you ain't playing that flute for him.  You got a crush on H.W.  H.W.'s just training me to live an ascetic life like her.  Mm-kay, I buy that for like zero seconds.  Before we hunt the thunderboar,  you should drink from this enchanted spring.  It might give you crazy dreams, but when you wake up,  you'll be immune to the boar's electrical attacks.  Let's roll those dice. Hey, dude, are you sure you want to do that?  Mm-hmm. Blah!  I've had plenty of weird dreams befo okay!  That was fast. Welcome. I am the spirit of the forest.  Wow, dude, we've been trying to summon you for weeks.  And why do you seek me?  I don't, personally,  but Huntress Wizard really wants to talk to you, man.  Did you know that a wolf's eyes are on the front of its head?  But, yeah, didn't you guys used to hang?  Most predatory species are like that.  This little buddy doesn't even know I'm here.  Fella, I don't want to have a science talk right now.  Huntress Wizard only sees straight ahead.  Eyes on the prize.  Now, why did you really need to see me?  Oh, yeah! Can you make me immune to electricity?  Here. Whoa.  Now plunge that into your heart.  And this'll give me immunity to electricity?  I'll do it To help Huntress Wizard.  Aah!  How long was I out?  Seven long, harrowing seconds.  Hold still.  Yeah, feels fine. Great.  Now we can hunt down the thunderboar.  Oh, yeah, the boar.  Try to stay focused.  Magic dog, what do you smell?  Mostly Finn but also some kind of giant wild pig.  There!  Jake's joking. I smell fine.  Eee!  Hey!  Good work.  You just wanted a tusk?  You could have asked!  Oh.  You can stop.  He is not coming.  He's gone for good, and I should just deal.  Maybe if I played it a little jazzier, like all syncopated?  Hey! Why don't you two try playing together?  Use that chemistry to guide the music.  Yeah, just get in there. Cozy up.  I guess we've tried everything else.  Wow!  What?!  Who summons me with the sweet song of longing?  Oh, hey-oh. Can you see me now?  Yes.  How's it been going?  I've been talking to a lot of twigs.  Where have you been, dude?  I've been right here.  But the forces that drew us close  became obscured  as you drifted into the lifestyles of magic city livin'.  Attracting forces come and go. It's the way of the world.  I still can't tell if you guys dated.  But I'm ready to come back now.  - Are you, though? - That's what I'm saying.  Finn, who was your flute spell for?  Um  I was playing my flute for you the whole time,  but I knew you had a thing with this dude, and he seems cool,  so I was just gonna keep playing this flute song  about my secret feelings until my flute broke.  I, uh I worry that hard meat don't get eat.  That is to say if I ever find what I'm looking for,  I'll become soft and I'll cease to matter in this world.  What?  Fear of softness is what drove me  to the mad and sad world of wizarding.  And, Finn  Yeah? What?  My flute spell was for you, too.  You're an exceptional beast, and you have great hair.  But exceptional beasts like us cannot fall in love.  That is the secret of ordinary people.  Uh, that's real dumb.  I agree.  Wait, you agree with me or her?  Take it easy, Huntress Wizard.  Man, I can't believe all you can do  is upgrade your armor in this game.  It's all about patience  and treating each grueling, repetitive battle  as if it were your first.  Finn: Oh, snap! Finally!  Whoo! Whoo!  Blah! Blah!  What a bad and boring game. It was just what I needed.  I'm sorry it didn't work out with Huntress Wizard.  She just needs time to miss how cool you are.  Attracting forces come and go, man.  


  _ Raaaah! Raaah! Come on! Get ready, toids! Raaah! I'm mean as a bus, and I'm mad as rocks! Gumball guardians! There's an enemy at the gates! I'm an all-you-can-eat maniac! Whoops! Aw, come on! Ooh, ooh, ooh! Whoopee! Thank you, little candies. Thank you. You warm the wax heart of this poor King of Ooo! Now, I hear you asking, "King of Ooo, how can you be so wise?" I'll tell you how. Did you know that I am 8,000 years old? Could be. It's true. I'm that wonderful. Now, Princess Bubblegum she says she hasn't gone rogue. She says she's not a wild dog thirsty for blood. She says she's not a literal baby masquerading as an adult woman. She says a lot of things. Princess Bubblegum, you don't make sense! This guy's really working on me. Ennnh Yes, dear? Do you have something to say? Mm-hmm. I'm James' mother, Mrs. James. My son got turned into a mutant mass and was exiled to the Badlands by Princess Bubblegum. Trehh! Boo. Who isn't mad about their mutant children? What about Sweet P, King of Ooo? You threatened to burn down his mama's orchard. I did. That is true. Sweet P, I was like a cornered animal. "I knew no' what thy doone." I'm sorry, Sweet P. Here. Psst give me a kiss. Do you hear us, Princess Bubblegum? Do you hear us?! Shhhhhhhhut up. Princess, I'm sorry to disturb you, but I feel that you must campaign. The candy people are real dumb. I'm studying something that could be real important. Dah! This dumb election. It's not even I mean, it's barely even Barely even legal. "A barely and yet fully legal election" That's what my campaign manager told me. Let's hear it for him Mr. X! Weird, right? And even being legal, I mean, I made everyone. I made their homes. The candy people are mercurial, but they're not dillweeds. And this definitely legal election is in the jam-covered fingers of you, the people The candies. So, go. Vote with your hearts. Vote with your minds. Vote for the candidate who's not a teenage gum-golem. I mean, they know that I love them. And the votes are in. King of Ooo is our new princess. Hey, hey! What?! Whaaaaat?! You dillweeds! You're a dillweed, you're a dillweed's secretary, and you're probably some dillweed I've never met! You're three dillweeds being dillweeds, and you're going to dillweed this place into the ground! And you Princess! Princess! I don't know what a dillweed is. Hey, PB, what's the plan? We pledged our allegiance to you. Your allegiance is to the kingdom. Dudes, I don't know. I don't know when I'll be back in charge If I'll be back in charge. I need you both to stick around here and make sure the candy people are safe, even if it means working for a wad. "Auf wiedersehen, meine champions." Mwah. Mwah.  There's a new golden and waxy mornin' Good times a-comin' You've got your warning There's cheap healthcare, the workcamp's there The general tone is laissez-faire I'm a princess, I'm a princess I'm a priiiinceeeess  What's up, Peps? It's stuck. Ho, no, no, no, no! It's okay, everyone. It's okay. Close your eyes and repeat your safety mantra Hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie - Princess? - Huh? Oh. Sorry, Peps. I'm just so used to having my citizens around to protect. This is gonna take some getting used to. Permission to speak freely, ma'am? Granted. This horrible dump does not meet the level of fancy to which I have become accustomed. Noted. Also, FYI My uncle Gumbald built this cabin with his bare hands. I spent my summers here when I was younger. Anyway, it'll probably take a really long time for the candy people to realize a bad ruler is worse than a good ruler. Plenty of time to spruce this place up. Whew! Starchy thought life would be better under the King of Ooo, but now there's even more stuff to sweep. Poor old Starchy. Always getting the sweaty end of the lollipop. Hey, Starchy. What are you doing Sweeping? Oh, uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Suh-wee-ee-eepin'. - Yeah. - Mm. Hey, is it me, or is getting purpler out here? Oh, yeah. I think that's the catalyst comet. Guess it's getting pretty close or whatever. Getting close? Should we evacuate or What? No, no. It's cool, I think. It's just here to, like, shake things up, you know? It's okay. We've got sort of a a relationship. C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-comet?! Oh, Starchy don't feel good about this. - Starch? - Eht. Starchy's mind is burdened. Oh, Mrs. Gumdrop! He's coming. The comet it's gonna snuff out all life as we know it. What?! Oh, good Glob! Shouldn't we try and calm them down? Ehh, not after that whole "knock my tower over onto the castle" thing. A lot of guys got smooshed. They need to hear it from someone they really trust. - King of Ooo! - King of Ooo! - King of Ooo? - King of Ooo? King of Ooo? Wait, are you saying "King of Ooo"? What are you saying? I thought it was "kinkoff goo." Hey. You hear that? Downstairs. King of Ooo? King of Ooo? King of Ooo! What the It's that guy from before. He's mucking around with PB's ship Added all kinds of engines to it. Hey! Hey, what do you think you're doing? PB don't let nobody touch her stuff Not even me, and I'm cool Least of all you, you sauce-tasting Brian-sniffer whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Yeeh! Yeeh! Whoa! Uhhh! No mercy, Jake. Aaaaah! Hey, I'm back What the bing bong ping pong?! Gunther?! What the king kong sing song?! Whoaaaa oof! Sayonara, suckers! Uhh Ugh! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Oww! Aaaaah! Toronto, I've been princess for four hours, and society has already totally collapsed. Plus, now the sky is falling, I guess. Is this possibly somehow my fault? Pbbt! No way! Okay, look. Without your calming presence and selfless leadership, this situation would have been a hundred times worse. History will remember you as Ooo's greatest hero. As always, the voice of reason. Once again, my saintly nature has compelled me, unthinking, to assume the burdens of others. But a true justice demands a true accounting. And truly this is all Bubblegum's fa-aa-aa-ault! Oof! Good Glob! What no-o-o-o-o-w? Looking good, Peps. Man, this feels kind of good, right? It's like we're building a whole new kingdom from scratch, only without all my beloved citizens this time. And their dull, pleading chicken eyes. Maybe the King of Ooo could hold down the fort for a little while. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? Anyway, I'm gonna get some fresh air. B.R.B. What the Why's it so purple outsid What the Why's it so purple outsi What? It's too smoky to see. Oh! Something's peeking. Someone's jacking your spaceship! That is my ship! But it looks like it's been modded out. That much engine power It'll break through the atmosphere before I can do anything to stop it. Finn and Jake! Yeah! Get that guy! Oof! My Thorn. I think we should go inside. Oof! Gunther! What are you doing?! What am I doing? A fog shrouds my true intent even from myself. There! The catalyst comet. It all becomes clear. I am more than Gunther. Like a mighty chrysalis pushing out of a damp cocoon, I emerge! Jake! You okay? Yeah, man. Just don't croak out here. Hey, man, look at Gunther. Behold! I am Orgalorg! Whoa. That's pretty. Looks good, right? Hey, where's Glob? I don't know. Um, he exploded in space. Yeah, thought so. Man, are you still Gunther? 'Cause you seem like you're not. I'm Orgalorg. Well, what the heck are you doing, Orgalorg? It was just time to come out again. Glob K.O.-Ing himself, the arrival of the catalyst comet, and a ship to carry me out of this planet's gravity These are doorways the universe presented to me. Oh, I know about open-door philosophy. What's that? You just say yes to stuff all the time? Pretty much. That seems all right. It's all yours, if you're willing to take it. Destroy worlds, crush anyone blocking the door. Feel their bones crumple and their goo spill out. I don't like that at all. He made it ugly. You can't stop me. I'm Orgalorg. I'm pretty sure I can take you, bro. Not after I absorb the power and knowledge of that comet. Absorb a triple salchow to your kneecaps. Oof! - Whoa! - Whoa! - Grab my hand! - Okay. Shoot. Hey, stop drifting! I'm not trying to! Ooh! Maybe I can use jet propulsion. Oh, no, I can't breathe. Jake, no! Don't worry, man! I'm working out a plan! Freaking bing bong! Jake's gonna fulfill his croak dream after all. And that dirty umbrella is gonna enslave the universe. Cram come on. This is gonna take forever. Man, I'm gonna croak out here, like a fish in the hands of a child. Okay, Finn. Time to make an appeal to greater forces.  Everything's falling into place I'm right where I should be The tides of life all led me here And that's why I'm not scared I know the answer will appear, ple-e-e-ease  Hey, spaceman. Wha dad?! This is so crazy, Finn. What are you doing out here? Floating to my grave! Hurry up and save me! Can't, buddy. This baby does what it wants. Are you kidding me?! No, for real. Look. Hey.  Get that guy there! See? I'm just flying random-style. It's not random! I merged my intention with the universe. You what? Oh! Wait. I have an idea. Really? Here grab on this. No, it's cool. You got gloves on. Oh, yeah. You all right? Yeah. Thanks, dad. Thanks, universe. Come again? Oh! We got to save Jake! He's out there choking on gas! Like I said, I got no control over this beast. We're on a journey into mystery, unless I figure out what this bozo responds to. It's kind of fun, right? See, there's no reason or purpose or what you said Uh, universal intention. Look around, Finn. Empty crud. So empty. I don't know. There's some stars and stuff. You're squeezed so tight, your bottom's gonna fall out. Put the phone down. "Put the phone down"? Yeah Whoa! What's going on, huh? Look! The light of the comet. Ahh. That's pretty neat. This moth is so bananas, man. "Bananas, man." "Bananas, man." Uh-oh. What's that? Almost there. That dude's gonna absorb the comet's mystical power and crush everybody. Who the heck raises guys like that? You think he had neglectful parents, like you? Or would he have always  been a no-good Orgalorg? Oh, Gob Slops! Not Orgalorg! You you you know him? Yeah! What do you think I'm a dumb brick? I don't know Orgalorg? Oh, yeah. Snaps! He ate the comet! I got to stop him. It's too late, buddy. It's out of our hands. Skronk that! I'm gonna use these hands to sock him in the chops! In the chops! Hey! Dinglord! In the name of The universe, stop that! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Grass sword. Raaa! Huh? Yah-ta-ta-ta-ta! Whoa. I didn't open this door. Cool. Finn, do you remember? Oh. Yeah, I-i think so. A long time ago, I was you, sort of. And I crashed on earth and became a butterfly or some biz. And I guess it was just some random absurd thing, just a joke I've been playing out for centuries. Who's creating the joke? Are you? And if so, then are you my creator? Uh, maybe. I don't know. Probably not. Probably not, but who knows? I've been around forever and experienced so much impossible junk. I've embodied all that is good and evil. And now we're here. It's unprecedented. And I give you a choice Come with me to the end and the beginning or struggle here awhile like a beautiful autumn leaf. What's that bell sound? Cool, man. This is your crisis. As you stand on the edge of freedom from love Hate Friendship Isolation Jealousy Secrets Violence Video games Ice-cream waffles Sadness Madness Power Honor Loyalty Saucy Mothers Fathers Scoundrels. How long are you gonna list stuff? It's a long list. You're telling me to abandon all this stuff, but you're not really making it sound bad. It's not bad. I'm just giving you the choice of a new mode of existence. I feel like I put a lot of work into this meat reality. I'd like to see it through. Fair enough. Hey, how about I get a new mode? Are you seriously trying to bail out again?! What? This deal sounds pretty good. Dad. Uh-oh. I know that look. When you fled the scene like a ding-dong-ditcher in the night Listen, Finn. No answer I give you will be satisfying. Besides, it was like 40 years ago. I'm 16! I don't have a star to revolve around to track time. Well, why do you always run from everything? You burn enough Bridges, the only direction to move is forward. Hm. Well, there ain't no changing you, I guess. Well, I'm glad we finally understand each other. Start the engine, comet boy! Prepare to discorporate. Goodbye, son! Bye, dad. I should have asked for a lift home. Unh! Jake! I thought I had lost You. Noooooo! - You okay, Finn? - What?! Jake! Banana man?! How? I was just floating around, and I drifted into B-man's flight path. Pretty random, right? I-I-it wasn't random. I did it. Let's get the jazz out of here. Nooooo! There we go. See? Problem took care of itself. You think Finn and Jake are all right? I'd say it's about a 50/50 chance. That's pretty much everything in life, isn't it? Yeah. Whoa! What's that?! Hey, PB. We took care of it. Good job, guys. Mm, I'm gonna croak out here.


     Aaah!  Hey, Jake. What's wrong? You look dumpy. How come? I-Is it because of that metal box? Is something sad inside? No. It's nothing. There's lots of boxes that have nothing in them. But also, you could put something in the box. And then it won't be empty! Does that make you feel better?  You're a charmer, Finn human. No. it'swell Lady Rainicorn doesn't want to play the game Card Wars with me. I always beat her. So she says, "no more card warring." What's Card Wars? It's a fantasy card game that's super-complicated and awesome, but, well oh, it's kinda stupid. Never mind. How come you never talked about it before? It sounds cool. - Really?! Well, I thought you'd say it was for nerds who do not know how life is outside of the nerd universe. L-it is, man. But I still totally want to play it. So no more moping, okay? Thanks, Finn.  Oh, hey, Beemo. You want to play, too? No! I do not play such games with Jake! - What's that mean? - JAKE: Ah, whatever. Let's play the game! So, what kind of stakes do we play for? How about the loser is a dweeb, and the winner is a cool guy? Those are good stakes. Coffee grounds, beetle butter, grape jelly, kimchi, aaand this stuff. Hey! You're ruining that pop with weird taste!  We drink when the game is over. Oh, gross. Now, let me explain the rules. That's basically the basics. So once we have our kingdom set up  it's time to start to play for the gloryyyy! Huh? Hey, were you asleep? I'll have to explain it all over again! Doesn't matter. Let's just play. But if you don't know the rules, then you're gonna lose in the first couple rounds, like Lady always does. And then you'll hate the game. And then you'll hate me! And then, and then -- Pfft! You think you're gonna win? I'm gonna crush you -- party-dance style, dweeb!  Bring it! So, how do I get my land on the map? Oh. You, uh, floop your land cards.  Uh Keep those honeys hidden, or I'll get a strategic advantage! Oh! Hmm Okay, I go first. I floop the Silo of Truth! Hey! Pfft! You got really lame cards. Hmm I'll take the Cerebral Blood Storm, though.  Huh? Okay, now it's the battle phase. I'm attacking your schoolhouse with my Husker Knights.  And, I'm casting Cerebral Blood Storm.  So, what do you use to defend?  Uh can my Cool Dog and Ancient Scholar defeat your Husker Knights?  Of course not! Hmm. Then I floop the pig What?!  - What? - Okay, okay. First of all, you don't floop a creature to make it fight. You activate a creature. Hmm. No! It says I can floop the pig. See? No! He's eating all my cornfields! My Husker Knights draw energy from corn! And since I'm not actually attacking, your Cerebral Blood Storm only does damage to your own kingdom's troops. You just wiped out my entire attack! What do you expect if all your power units come from corn? Pigs eat corn, dude. Cornfields stink. Cornfields are awesome! What makes you think you know so much about Card Wars?! - It's just logic. - Your turn. Hmm You're supposed to discard a card and pick up a new one first. Oh, right. Look at you. You're a babe in the woods. Your beginner's luck ends this round! Hmm. Spirit Tower! And the Cave of Solitude?! Now my battle phase begins. I activate my ancient scholar to begin studying. And I also move my pig to the Cave of Solitude so he can take a nap. That's it? You're not attacking? I'll attack on a different turn. Ha! Then the seas have aligned and the five winds waft the smell of victory to my palace doors! I cast "Field of Nightmares" and activate my legion of ear-lings to scare your pig to death!  La, la, la, la  My pig's in the Cave of Solitude. Um I cast "Teleport" to move your pig to the empty field so I can attack him! Uh wouldn't "Teleport" only work on your own creatures? - You're right. I'm gonna slay that pig, though. How? You don't have any creatures that can touch him. Ugh! Face it, man. I'm the cool guy. Hmm  You're the cool guy, huh? Well, let me make it a little hot for you, then.  I floop the volcano. What?! That'll destroy your kingdom, too, won't it?! Hmph! Maybe on! ' Aah! My pig!  La, la  Aah!  The pig is dead. Now I reconstitute my cornfields using the "Reclaim Landscape" spell. My Husker Knights, revive!  And I still have my battle phase. Hiding in the useless swamp, the Immortal Maize Walker! I love corn! Ah! Cornfields give the immortal maize walker triple damage. Uh I told you cornfields are awesome! Your Ancient Scholar and Cool Dog won't survive this time. Actually, my Ancient Scholar's been studying the "Raise the Dead" ability. - So what? - So My Ancient Scholar raises the dead.  I floop the Pig- No-o-o-o-o-o! Look. My tower's doing a thing. Hominy-hominy-hominy! You ganked my Spirit Walker! Ah!  Uh, maybe we should take a break?  Your turn. Huh? You play! You play! Oh, zang. I do not play such games with Jake. Sorry! I gotta use the boy style room. Beemo! Beemo! Beemo chop! If this were a real attack, you'd be dead. Beemo! Jake's acting boonoonoonoos! Oh, no! Are you winning the game of Card Wars? - Yeah! - That's terrible! If Jake loses that game, he gets super depressed! When I beat him, he wouldn't talk to me for a month! What?! I only played so he wouldn't be bummed! Finn, you must take a dive. Okay, I'll try. But I'm a Card Wars super Amadeus. Whoop! Play the game.  Grob. Better make this look good.  All right, Jake. Prepare for my ultimo-attack! Well, I've still got my Wandering Bald Man. Oh, no.  I need to get rid of my pig so Jake can reconstitute his cornfields. I activate the pig to attack your Wandering Bald Man. That's stupid. Just attack with Immortal Maize Walker and get the game over with! No way! You've underestimated me and my pig all day.  Please lose. Please lose. No-o-o-o!  Oh-ho! Oh! Oh, yeah! Pigs can't leave mud landscapes once they're on them! Ha ha ha! The pig is mine! First, I'll play Reclaim Landscape. Then I cast "Summon Archer Dan." Whoa, math  M'boys! You have no creatures left. That's the game, boy! The five winds blow through cornfields once again for the glory of Jakoria! Heh. You got me. In your face! It's time to drink up! JAKE: It looks like you are the dweeb and I'm the cool guy.  Is it too gross for you, man? No, no. I got to take what's coming to me. Hey, it's not that bad! I like it! - What?! - You want a taste?  Ah, it's gross!  In your face, dweeb!   Come along with me and the butterflies and bees Jâ  We can wander through the forest and do so as we please Come along with me to a cliff under a tree  


     This stanks. Hey, how much longer till we get to the mysterious party? Let me check the spooky invite sent to us by our anonymous host. Oh. We're here. Party's in that castle.  It's for us! What's it say? "Wear me." BOTH: "Wear me"?  Hello? BUBBLEGUM: Yoo-hoo! Hey, guys! Princess Bubblegum, is that you? Why, yes, indeed. Although, according to the invitation, we're supposed to use mystery names, and mine is "Lady Quiet Bottom." My name is "Duchess Gummybuns." I am "Professor Pants." I'm "Cinnamon Bun." What's the name on your invite? Oh, yeah. Uh, it's "Guy Farting." "Prince Hotbod" at your service. I'm "Randy Butternubs." So, who's our host, anyways? Nobody knows. Maybe he'll be a steaming-hot babe with huge money. Tut, tut, Lumpy Space Princess. What would your boyfriend, Brad, say? Brad and I broke up a long time ago. Duh!  Now's my chance! Noway! But I can make you happy. Puke off, you big doughnut! Okay. Excuse me, "Guy Farting," there's an envelope on your back.  Where? Where? FINN: Here -- let me. Did you put that envelope on him? No. Nope. - Unh-unh. I didn't do it. No. What's it say, "Prince Hotbod"?  "Esteemed Guests, I am your host. I am a ghost."  "By the time you finish reading this, I will possess one of you and use your body to murder everyone in the house."  Aah! We got to get out of here! FINN: C.B., wait. It says anyone who tries to leave will die! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Ergh! He's dead! Yeah, right. What do you mean, "Yeah, right"? Come on. You don't remember when I pulled this same trick on your birthday? I used the fake skeletons to make you think everyone was dead. It looks real to me. Psh! Classic move. Dude, I swear I'm not pranking you. Cinnamon Bun is dead. The question is, who killed him? One of us is possessed by a murderer, and if we want to stay alive, we have to figure out who's hiding a ghost inside their mortal body. Beemo! - Aah! Use your ghost-detecting equipment to screen everyone. I blinked my balls -- my eyeballs.  BEEMO: Hmm. What do you mean, "Hmm"? Nothing. PRINCESS BUBBLEGUM: Did you just see that? LUMPY SPACE PRINCESS: Oh, I knew it. I knew it was Jake. Processing data - Ew. - Huh? So, who's the ghost, Beemo? Oh. Um, I don't have ghost-detecting equipment. I just like taking nice pictures. Let's find some candles. If the lights go out again, we'll be able to catch the murderer. Good idea. Jake and Beemo, you guys check downstairs, and we'll take this floor. Okay.  JAKE: Lay truth on me, Beemo. Is Finn pulling some elaborate prank on me? No, Jake. When bad things happen, I know you want to believe they are a joke. But sometimes, life is scary and dark. That is why we must find the light. Aha!  Found it! Ooh!  Thanks, Beemo. Beemo? Help! Jake, help! Beemo? Help! Aaaaaaaaaah! Oh, my crease! Oh, my crease! Assemble! Reassemble! Come on, you guys! Where's Beemo? The ghost got him. Don't you mean you got him Ghost?! You guys, if there really is a ghost killer, then we should stay in a group. He can't take us all on if we're in a group.  LSP, where are you?! Are you okay? JAKE: It sounds like she's in there. LSP: Aah! I'm dying!  Whew! Oh, gross. Ugh! My lumping body's all hollow now. I got to put something in it. So, where's the food? What kind of castle is this? It's like a poor people's castle, with no lumping waffles for my dump truck! Chill out, girl. You find any candles upstairs? No. Well, I dropped a lighter downstairs, but there's no way I'm going back for that. Uh-huh. Let me remind y'all that the invite says "The ghost will possess one of our bods." LSP: Not my bod. Someone at this table isn't who they appear to be. That's right "Jake." So let me ask you a question only the real Jake could answer. FINN: Who is always next to me in my recurring elevator dreams? A half-orc Shaman. Okay, you're Jake. So, who else was absent when Beemo got nabbed? Oh, yeah, right. I'm not the ghost. I was in the potty house. A convenient alibi. But tell me this Why did you break up with Brad? Only the real LSP would know that. Pshaw! As if you even know the answer to that, Jake! You're right. I'm just feeling gossipy, and I want to know what happened. That's none of your lumping business! Sounds suspicious. I bet you're the ghost! She did it! She's possessed! Tie her up! Oh, she is,huh? Well, before we tie up LSP, answer me this LSP: Brad -- He kissed me on the mouth, and I was like, "Bleh! Bleh! Bleh!" And then I was like, "Oh, gross! Go away, Brad!" And he was like, "Obvi, you're not ready for me." But what does that even mean, you guys?  What does it lumping mean?  But answer me this, Princess LUMPY SPACE PRINCESS: What do you want from me, Brad?! You said I was the hottest one! Isn't that enough?! Why'd you have to --  What did I write to you on your "Happy Birthday" card two years ago? Word for word. Finn, there's no way I would remember that. I remember that. You're not PB! Tie you up!  What?! Wait, you guys!  Look!  A real ghost?! Aah! Don't touch me! Don't touch me!  Da-a-a-a-a-a-g! This wasn't supposed to h-h-happen! Aha! I knew you were pranking me back, you! Yeah, i-it was all a setup -- the doors, Cinnamon Bun and Beemo. Oh, Striz! Beemo and Cinnamon Bun should be in the closet over there. Guys! Guys, guys! Come on, you gu-- Aaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! Oh, my Glob! I can't take this, you guys. I'm calling my lumping parents right now.  Aaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaah! FINN: LSP, what's happening?! Aaaaah! Oh, my glob! I'm not ready! Get away! Oh, gross! Aaaaaaah! Where did she go?! Look! I'm scared, Bro.  Run, homey! Run! FINN: Open it!  It won't open! Muh! Aah! Whoooooo! BOTH: Aaaaah! Oof! Come on! Okay. Oh! Jake! Ow! Ow! Ow! I got a splinter! Jakey! Whaaa! Don't let go, man! FINN: Oh, no! Your fancy glo-o-o-o-ves! Aaaaaaah!  Unh! Jake! Princess!  Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Unh! Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Ha-haaa! Gotcha, dude! Two for two. What?! I figured out your plan months ago, so I flipped the script. Oh, yeah! So everyone's okay -- Beemo, Cinnamon Bun? Yeah. See? Whoa! Sick! You can phase people into your body?  I'm ready for you now, Brad. Isn't that Obvi? I'm so ready. But, PB, you melted. It was a wax dummy, Dummy. Jake switched me out while lady was distracting you. Wow. You got me again. I can't believe that -- With the hair and the house coming alive and stuff. The what? The walls and chairs trying to eat me and stuff. Eh, no. You must have been so scared, you imagined that part. Umno, I didn't. Ha ha. Nice try, Finn. Let's get out of here.  That one's going in the vault. And It's gone.    


-  -  -  -   Finn:  That's the comet you're supposed to follow. Finn: Right. Right. I knew that. Hey, be careful, okay? Hold on tight. Finn: It's okay. I won't ever let you go.  That's true. Wow. Already? That was fast. Yep. We're here. It's time to wake up now. - Finn: What? Now? - Yep. - Finn: Like, right now? - Y Finn:  Ah. Where am I? What the heck? Is that the comet? And a little farming village? How long have I been walking? Man, two whole days at least. - Finn: Wow. I need some water. - No, wait ah geez. Finn: Hmm. Fields are looking a little sparse. Kind of runty. Wonder if this village even has any wat oh, snap! I see some!  Excuse me, sir. Could I have some water? I've been sleepwalking for days.  Awesome. Heck yeah! Thanks, little friend! You just totally saved my life. No pun intended. What's the matter? Can't talk? Oh. Or are you guys comet boyz? From up in there? Listen, I'm no expert, but I think y'all are gonna need a lot more corn. And it's supposed to stand straight-up-like. Or maybe comet boyz only need just, like, a - little bit of limp corn? - No, I'm a regular guy. I I'm just not supposed to talk to strangers. Lionel, what did I tell you about talking to strangers?! You get your butt inside this instant! -  Human boy! - Finn: What the ? The tree spirit does not permit freeloaders! Either help fetch the escape-pod engine or kindly move along. - Finn: Dad? - Wait! Wait! What are you doing? Don't come over here! Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Finn: Dad? Ptooooooooooooo! - Finn! - Finn: Dad? Both: What the heck are you doing here? Finn: What? You were just yelling at me. No, no, that was the tree spirit commander of all trees, bringer of hard times. Finn: Dad. You're not falling for it, huh? Well, it was worth a try. You know, those little guys down there, they'll do anything for the tree spirit. I got them fetching parts to fix my escape pod instead of planting their fields. Isn't that sweet? Finn: Dad, your arm. Oh, this?  Yeah. When my ship crashed, I got shot out of the window. I knocked a kite out of the air, then caught my arm in a woodpecker hole. Finn: Whoa. But it's cool, you know. Arms come and go. It's family that's important.  Speaking of arms, though, I see you got yourself a brand-spankin'-new one. How about that?! Finn: Oh. Yeah. -  I got it from my P.B. dream sword. - Uh-huh. Neat. Finn: Actually, for a while there, I thought if I ever saw you again, I was gonna tear your arm off. Well, shoot. Who could blame you? Yeah. But you definitely don't feel that way anymore, right? Finn: No. No. It's  it's okay now.  Great! Great. How about a hug? Finn:  What the heck, dad?! Is everything you say a lie? No, no. 'Course not. >> Finn: Well  is there any way I can tell the difference?  I hope not. -  - Hot dang! Hold that thought. Those little guys are back with the engine bulb for my pod. Excuse me.  I am sending forth my holy emissary, Martin Mertens, and his regular son, Finn. Don't forget to do whatever Martin tells you! Almost there. Little further. Uh-huh. Little further. Keep it coming. There you go. A little further. And stop. Fantastic work, boys. Absolutely fantastic. -  - Finn: Holy stonk, dad! You're messing them all up! This is why you're lying to them? So they'll mess themselves up for you? Wha?! No, no, no! Look they love it. See? - Goochy goochy goo! - - Goochy goochy! -  They're helping a poor, old, stranded man in need. You like to help people, don't you? I I'd do it myself if I could, but I'm too strong to fit through the service hatches. Come on! Gimme a chance!  They're gonna fetch me one last piece, and you and I can watch them do it. Then I'll be out of your hair by tomorrow morning. Finn: Oh. Right. Yeah, don't worry. I know I'm cramping your style - down here, am I right, huh? - Finn: Uh yeah. - Yeah, I I guess. -  Sure I am! Now let's go fetch that piece. Finn: It's really warm down here. -  Whoa! -  Well, yeah, son. That's just the ship cooking. One thing about this ship it cooks. Finn: Should it be cooking? Nah, but that's just real life. Okay, babies, I need this piece. It's a steering wheel. It's in the steering room.  Last one in breaks tree spirit's heart! >> Finn: Wait! Wait! W-w-wait! You don't have to go in there if you don't want to. Nah, I think we want to. Okay, I know, I know. Listen, that's the last piece of the pod, right? Well, I promise I'll make it up to the little boogers tonight.  Come here!  Live it up, pals! This is your night! Hey, hey! Careful with the finish. That buggy's ready to blast.  Yo! Party animals! Still hungry? - Mm-nn-mm. - Come on. Tree spirit says! Scoop it till you poop it! Let's get gross! - Finn? - Finn: Oh. Sorry. So you guys want to learn another one? Okay, watch this. Cute. Uh, hey So, you guys really believe in the tree spirit? Eh, not really, I guess. We're kind of just looking to help out. Finn: Hmm. Hey! It's Finn with the grin! Mind if I sit down? Finn:  >>  Look at this! You ever see someone sit like this? Finn: I guess not. Hey, Martin? - Yeah? - Finn: Uh, I think I really need some answers to stuff like where did I come from or - who's my mom? -  Whoops. Okay, uh, long story short you were born on a boat I guess. Like a - banana boat - in the middle of the ocean. So all kinds of stuff tried to eat you whales and fish squids. - Uh, there was a tiger - and seaweeds. - The sea's weeds. - Finn:  Your mom was okay. I don't know. Talking about it stresses me out. Maybe later. So, one day, I got called on a dangerous mission no, like a dangerous life choice, two roads diverging in the night and all that. And I couldn't bring you along. I always planned to come back for you, but I didn't. That's true. The end! Look out! Everything is ruined. Everyone is fat. Finn: Aah!  - Martin! - Again? Oh, good morning, sweetie! - Finn: Martin, are you leaving?! -  I absolutely gotta, kid. I got pressures on me, stuff you wouldn't understand. Finn: But what about the villagers?! That ship looks like it's gonna blow up! Uhhhhh maybe. I don't know. Maybe it won't blow up. I've seen 100 things weirder than a ship not blowing up. Finn: Oh, dad! - I need to go shut it off! - Okay, okay, wait! Wait. If you're gonna turn it off, you got to pull the heat-dump toggle in the engine core. It was too snug for me to get to, and those little guys aren't strong enough. Hmm. Hey, I could wait for you. Maybe we could go into space together. Finn: Why didn't you tell me about the heat dump in the first place?! I don't know. - Wink. -  Finn: Daaaaaah! What the Finn: Heat dump!  Too stuck! Ohhhh, no. This is new to me. Mm  Finn:  Man, you know what's weird? That wasn't even a comet that crashed back there. So, then, what was that dream about? I don't get my brain. Okay, when we get back to the tree house, let me do the talking.


     FINN: Jake?! Beemo?! Hey, man, what you doing?!  Dude! Don't worry, bro. We won't tell anyone about the "private time" you spend with your wad of Princess Bubblegum's hair. You guys knew? Finn, we're roommates, which is why I'm gonna share my beloved keepsake with you.  My old baby blanket.  Hmm-hmm! Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm! Who are you? Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm! Grr! Hmm-hmm-hmm! No! Hmm-hmm! Come on!  I'll get your kid back, toy!  Hmm. Hmm! That guy must do crazy squats. BUBBLEGUM: Get back here, you thieving Door Lord! You butt! Come on, Bubblegum! Finn?  MARCELINE: Aaahh! Aaahh! FINN: Marceline! Are you okay? MARCELINE: Yeah. Don't worry. We'll get him.  No!  What?! "This door shall yield to no command, save for a song from a genuine band." What is this grippa grap? It's the door of the Door Lord, Finn. We used to lock them up, but they kept breaking out, 'cause they're Door Lords. They broke out because you let them live.  Hmm. The door said it'll open for a genuine band. Let's try to music this door open as a quintet. Can I be the jerk in the band? 'Cause that's an important part of a band's success. Hmph! I know how to get through this door. We're gonna lay down a chill jam. Hey! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Just keep it cool. Got that, Princess? Hmph! Ohh! Oh! My face!  Let's see if you hacks can keep up with my raw talent. Hyah! La-da-da da-da I'm gonna bury you in the ground La-da-da da-da I'm gonna bury you with my sound I'm gonna drink the red from your pretty pink face I'm gonna --  Marceline, that's too distasteful. Oh. You don't like that? Or do you just not like me?!  Sorry I don't treat you like a goddess ls that what you want me to do? Sorry I don't treat you like you're perfect Like all your little, loyal subjects do Sorry I'm not made of sugar Am I not sweet enough for you? ls that why you always avoid me? That must be such an inconvenience to you Well, I'm just your problem I'm just your problem It's like I'm not even a person, am I? I'm just your problem Well, I-I-I Shouldn't have to justify what I do I-I-I Shouldn't have to prove anything to you I'm sorry  It's working! Look at the door!  landed me on your blacklist But I-I-I Shouldn't have to be the one that makes up with you So why do I want to? Why do I want to? To bury you in the ground And drink the blood from your --  Ugh! Stop staring at me! Ugh! You threw me off! FINN: Come on, everybody! Don't stop now! The door was responding to our music! I wonder what it liked or what was missing. Well, I know what's missing -- talent. I'm getting out of here, you hacks -- talentless hacks! Yikes. Maybe to be a genuine band, we need to be nicer to each other and hang out as buds. Let's take a noodle break. Come on! It'll help! No! Wait! Don't go, too! I'm just gonna get stuff to cook that. Cook? That was sweet what you said about being buds. Mm-hmm. Thanks. I'm back, yo. Come here, baby. Oh! Pasta water Getting hotter. A song about noodles? BOTH: No! Oh.  For our next attempt, I want to be the lead. Yeah. Sounds cool, my bud. Hmph! Jake! You're back! Shut your face. I came back for the music. Beemo, execute song structure Alpha.  Marceline, begin playing triplet quavers in the mixolydian mode. All right. Fine. Wait. What's a quaver? Now, Finn, vibrate your uvula by dampening and undampening your larynx. What?! Go like this, silly. Oh.  Waaaaa Okay. Okay. Jake, are you gonna join in?  Grr! Everyone, just stick to my blueprints.  Oh!  One more time? I may have, um, miscalculated. Ha! Looks like you aren't as perfect as you thought. Guess you can't judge me anymore. I never said you had to be perfect! All right. Time out, guys. Princess! Princess, wait! Whatever. Oh! I'm out of here, too! Marceline  You've all forgotten about the music. I quit the band! I'm just pretending. Jake! Everybody! We can beat the Door Lord -- together. Everyone Bubblegum I'm so dumb I should have just told you What I lost Was a piece of your hair Now it's gone Gone forever But I guess, what does it matter when I just Just had all of you there? Oh I just had all of you there with me, my friends If you're even my friends  You like this? This is what was missing. The truth!  What am Ito you? Am I a joke, your knight, or your brother? What am Ito you? Do you look down on me 'cause I'm younger? Do you think that I don't understand? I just wanted us together and to play as a band Last night was the most fun I've ever had Even liked it when the two of you would get mad at each other Oh You a-a-a-are my best friends in the world You a-a-a-are my best friends in the world That's ri-i-i-ight I'm talking 'bout the two of you, girls And you, Jake I wanna sing a song to you And I refuse to make it fake What am I to you? Am I a  BOTH:  Joke, your knight, or your brother? What am I to you? Do you look down on me 'cause I'm younger? Do you think that I don't understand? I just wanted us together and to play as a band I'll forget that I lost a piece of your hair I'll remember the pasta that we shared Over there Ah, ah  BOTH:  You a-a-a-are My best friends in the world You a-a-a-are My best friends in the world  BOTH:  That's ri-i-i-ight I'm talking 'bout the two of you, girls And you, Jake I'm gonna sing a song to you And I refuse to make it fake  BOTH:  Ahh, ahh Make no mistake I'm gonna sing a song that feels so real It'll make this do-o-o-r break  Hmm-hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm.  Hmm? Hmm-hmm-hmm. It's over, Drawer Lord. So, hand over our stuff! Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Hmm? What's he trying to say? I totally get it. He may have stolen our treasures But by doing so, he showed us that the real treasure is friendship. Hmm-hmm-hmm! Hmm-hmm! Hmm-hmm-hmm! Hmm! Okay. Here's that lock of Bubblegum's hair you love so much. Oh, you! Ah, yeesh. And here's Jakey's blanky. Here's your controller, Beemo. Yippie-ki-yi-yay! Marceline, here's your rock shirt. Hey, that's not -- That's mine! That's mine. You kept the shirt I gave you? Yeah. It, uh, means a lot to me. But you never wore it. Dude, I wear it all the time -- as pajamas. Wait. If that's Bubblegum's shirt, what are you missing, Marceline? Wait a second. Wait a second! You don't have a thing. You just wanted to hang out with us. No, I didn't! No way. You're caught. I figured you out. Uhhhh! I'll kill you! 


  Princess, he did it! Root Beer Guy set up the force field! But he sacrificed himself to do it. It's an ugly scene, man. Let me see. Rest in peace, Root Beer Guy. Give up now, Princess, and I, Maja the Sky Witch, promise not to completely donk up your kingdom. I make no such promise. Darren must feed. Oh, glob! Oh, oh, oh! Oh, well. What can you do? Crunchy, chill. Chill. Keepers of the clock, masters of dimension, bear witness! By my power, I compel you to converge! Past and present, be one. Awaken the terror of a forgotten age in this moment that is all moments in the blink of an eye. Darren, the ancient sleeper, arise! I had a dream I was fighting an army that could birth new soldiers from their own blood. I was endless. Does that make sense? Yes. You want to go conquer the Candy Kingdom? What's that? It's a place that contains the highest levels of caring and sentimental affection in all of Ooo. What is caring? What kind of world is this? It's a feeling I use in my magic to give me power. Like this shirt that was once the prized possession of Princess Bubblegum. With the feelings in this shirt, I was able to summon you. I don't walk me through this. All right. - This kingdom of candy - Yes? I will lay it to waste, turn their people to salt. Yeah And garnish a million meals with the salt, which we will eat for eternity. That's not my plan exactly, but you'll be fine. I promise. I promise, as well, to deliver destruction so thorough that all realities are affected. Okay. We'll talk about that. All realities. Hey! We'll talk about it! Break this witch out, Darren. How long will your force field hold, Gridface Princess? The sleeper's magic is older than legend. I don't know how he disabled both Gumball Guardians, but at least I know my tech is tight. The field will hold long enough for you to think of a weak plan. Colonel Candy Corn? Hrr, uh, yes, Princess. Ready the cannons, you got me? If they get through that barrier, I don't want to have to use our ground troops. Will do, Princess. And let me just say thank you for putting this old crease back in the field. I haven't been the same since my lovely Linda passed away. Yeah. Good luck. Oh, I tried dating again, you know? But these young girls think I'm too serious or something. Why don't you date someone your own age? Peppermint Butler, come on! Oh, women my age don't hang out. Where are they hiding? I need a young girl with an old soul to heal my heart. This is taking too long. Then do the thing! I call forth the legion of Cadmus, The Dragon's Teeth! What am I supposed to Oh! Party's starting. Load 'em up, soldiers! Yeah, just put it in there. I don't know. Oh, dang! Blah, gah, lah, glah! Fire! Whoo! Blah! Finn and Jake, are you ready to What the? Finn? Where the jam is Finn?! I don't know. Weren't they just here? What the jam?! All right. Finn or no Finn, PB's got to get in that biz. Hyah! Why have you stopped firing? We ran out of ammo, Colonel. That's nonsense, soldier. Rah! Ah! This is how you defend your kingdom! Fire, you wimps! Ya-ha! Ah! For the kingdom! For the king Oh, zang! ingdom! Eat it, tranch! Oh! Aah! Oh! It's over, Princess. Prepare to be annihilated across all dimensions. Princess! No! Wait, Darren! Dial it back. I need her residual feelings. What the flip is feelings? Darren only understands life and death! Wah! What the slizz? Yeah, boy! Hi, Darren. The Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant?! Eli, were you asleep forever, too? All this stuff is different now. What are we even doing here? Yes, it's been a difficult adjustment. Blaze his face, Eli! Yes, master. Yo! Leave me out of it! No! Yeah, right. Finn, his weakness is his brain-seed. Okay! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Oh, uh! Aah! Thank you. Whoa! Well, I guess my kids still have a daddy. Bam, you dope! Party tonight in the Candy Kingdom! - Hey, where's Finn? - Hi. Okay. Y'all bring food and bevs. Finn, you make the guac, all right? I'll the guaaaaaaaac. Finn! Finn! Yo! What's up, A. P.T. Dubs. E? What do I do now? Dude, I don't know. Probably not go back in the basement. You're so big'uns. You should be free, boy. Free to do what? I need psychic commands. Can you help me dice tomatoes for this guac? - No. You see, man, I feel weird giving you orders. You should just do your own thing. Realize your potential. But this is what I am a war machine who serves its master. No, man. You're more than that. Whoops. I see into your brain, remember? You'll do great. Just go for it. I believe in you, man. Oh, word. Thanks. Maybe Darren was right. There's no place for my ancient ways. Don't think like that, dude! Come back and see us whenevs! I'm doing this for a reason. What choice is there? Hungry! Hungry! Hungry! Must feed babies. Hey! Elephant. I'm more ancient than you. Someday, I will engulf the solar system. What was and what will be is meaningless. Meanwhile, you should wonder are you just a two-headed pile of meat on a crash course with the cosmic dump? Or do you contain the soul memory of a million dead stars? How do you light a candle without a match? Hello? Who's that? Why can't I see jack? You bonked your head. You're in a coma. But I can help. Um, all right. Are you, like, powerful? Yes. I can fly and do lasers from my nose. Okay. I can run with this. Take me to the Candy Kingdom and shoot your laser nose at it. No. I must decide, in this moment, what is best. For now, I am the match and the candle. What? I will be your friend and keep you alive, until you regain consciousness, maybe. Ugh, that plan sounds like dirt! See through my eyes, Maja. Ah! It's bright! Wait! You're the flippin' elephant! You laser-nosed me! Somebody help! Oh, my glob. Somebody! Well, this wasn't part of my plan. Hey, man. I'm gonna eat you.  Come along with me  And the butterflies and bees We can wander through the forest And do so as we please Come along with me To a cliff under a tree  This party is so crazy!


     FlNN: Jake! Jake! Jake? Hmm.  JAKE:  Huh?  That sounded horrible, man! l don't know how to play. Exactly! Huh? Let's go. Oh, wait up. l got to finish tuning my viola. Soft People, why are you all in a tizzy? The Gut Grinder -- he's back! The Gut Grinder? Yes, the Gut Grinder is a gold-eating monster. ln the past, the soft people of this village enjoyed piling our gold in the center of town and dancing wildly around it. lt was awesome!  But then the Gut Grinder came and stole our pile of gold. So we adapted and learned how to hide our gold using a big cup. And it worked! The Gut Grinder didn't come back. But recently, and admittedly it was probably a bad idea, we took our gold out from under the cup, and we put it in the center of town  'cause -- 'cause we really like dancing around it. But, boy, oh, boy, was that a mistake. You know what happened? Uh, it came back and ate all your gold?  Yes. Oh, yes. Aw, don't cry, soft old man. l'll find this monster and bring peace to this village. l swear! Swear to what? l swear to justice! Wow! He swears to justice. Okay, so, what does he look like? Oh, it's so scary. We usually close our eyes and go wee-wee when he attacks. But he left this footprint.  What? Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!  His paw matches the footprint.  l'm so scared! l'm gonna go wee-wee! Whoa! No, no, no, no, no! Calm down, everybody. This is my friend -- Jake the dog. Oh, thank goodness. Yeah. l almost wee-weed. Wait. You were gonna wee-wee if l was the Gut Grinder? Oh, yeah. We're terrified of him. Then l am the Gut Grinder! l'm gonna wee-wee! That guy wee-wees weird. l'm just kidding, everybody. l'm not the Gut Grinder. l'm Jake the dog. Whoo-hoo! Kawaii. He's just a cute, little dog. - Hey, l'm not cute! - Doggy! - Huh? - Pet, pet, pet.  Uh Oh. Mmm. -  - What?! l didn't say anything. People of the village of soft people -- l, Finn, and my buddy Jake will find this monstrous monster and slay it!  Come on! Let's go, Jake!  What?! No!  Bye-bye, doggy. Bye, Soft Village. Hey, Finn, my feet fit these prints pretty well. Hmm, what if l really am the Gut Grinder?  Dude, your paws will fit anything.  That is true! Check this out. ''l'm Finn the human, and l stink at viola.'' ''l'm just a dog, and l put my nose in poop.'' There's a lot of interesting smells in poop. Huh?  Hey, Cube People, what's going on here? The Gut Grinder stormed into our village and ate all of our gold. Wait. What happened? ALL: Aah! The Gut Grinder! Whoa! No, no, no! He's not the Gut Grinder. He's my friend. We saw the Gut Grinder, and he looks exactly like him!  That -- that's ridiculous. Jake, back to your normal size! Oh, yeah. l am not the Gut Grinder Ooh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh  Aww, he's just a cute, little dog. Hey, y'all are the ones who are cute! l'm hot! Aww, look. He's all mad. Even cuter.  So cute! Oh, so cute! l'm not cute! l'm -- ooh! We are also seeking the Gut Grinder. Me and my friend Jake will find it and slay it. Tell us what he looked like. Exactly like him, but bigger. Huh. Which way did he go? Jake! Hey, come on! - What? Where am l? - Thanks, guys! l'm not cute. l'll mess you up. Uh, Finn, w-what if l am the Gut Grinder? What?! What if l'm, like, stealing gold in my sleep? You can't be stealing gold in your sleep. l watch you while you sleep. What? Yo, Finn, that is creepy, man. l can't help it. l take pictures. Well, when do you sleep? Justice never sleeps. Well, there's got to be a time when you're not watching me -- that -- l-l might be stealing gold unconsciously. You are not the Gut Grinder!  City in danger. City in danger. Let's go! Oh, wait. What if these guys think you're the Gut Grinder? Hmm.  Aha! Got the perfect thing for you! Groucho glasses. l love it!  Launch in 3 2 1 ! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!  Oh, man. These people are a mess. Halt! ldentify yourselves immediately. l am Finn the hero! l'm Groucho. We're on a mission to catch the Gut Grinder.  l am the mayor of this village. Our gold has just been stolen by the very monster you speak of.  l hereby vow to catch that thief and bring your gold back. Our people thank you. l present to you this photo of the Gut Grinder to help in your mission. Oh, thanks. What? Finn, it's me. Well, duh, it looks like you. We already knew that. lt's just one of those weird coincidences, like how my belly button looks like your face. Yeah, l-l know you think it does, Finn, but this is different. l'm scared, Finn. Jake, stop it!  What? Oh, it's the Gut Grinder!  No, no, no, no, no! He's not the Gut Grinder. l swear on my good name and justice and Jake's cute face. His face is weird. The truth is obvious. Your friend is the Gut Grinder! No! You are under arrest for stealing our gold. l'll get you out of here -- somehow. No, Finn. l belong behind bars. Look at the evidence. l really am the Gut Grinder. Buddy, listen to me. You've been my best friend for as long as l can remember. That's enough evidence to prove to me that you're not a monster. Then why am l in jail? Only Gut Grinders go to jail. l'm in jail, and l'm not the Gut Grinder.  l'm here for the free grub!  Huh? Wait! l got an idea!  Hey, Gut Grinder, l got some gold here that you missed!  Come and get it! Huh? -  Whoa. You're the Gut Grinder? Oh, Gut Grinder. Oh, Gut Grinder. Huh?  You're a little cutesy. Little cutesy wutesy.  Am l the Gut Grinder? All the clues fit. l must be the Gut Grinder. And l want gold! Woo-hoo! Yeah! We got him! Thanks for saving me, Jake.  l'm not Jake! l'm the Gut Grinder! Now give me that gold tooth! What? Jake? Whoa! Whoa.  Now give me that tooth! lf l give you this stupid tooth, will you stop being a crazy jerk?!  Uh, what the -- Jake, you never turn into a monster when l want you to. lt's always ''not now, Finn. l have a headache.'' Oh, Jake, your viola is all l have now.  Huh? Stay away from my viola. You remember your viola! l also remember that you stink hard at playing it! And dookie is radical, man! l don't care what anyone says! Wow. Huh? What?! Where am l?! Finn, is that you?! Who else would it be, baby? Phew! Guess l went nuts. You are so crazy, man. Like -- like actually crazy.  lt's good to have you back. lt's good to have you pat my back. Man, if l'd known you were so easily manipulated, l would have eaten more of your ice cream. Cut it out!  Cut open the Gut Grinder's belly! Let's get our gold back. What the? What the? Sharon, what are you doing in the Gut Grinder? That's the mayor's wife! That's not the mayor's wife. And the Gut Grinder's skin is not skin at all. lt's cloth. Sharon, have you been sewing?! Yes, Cameron! l've been stealing gold. Why, Sharon?! Because l like to buy things, Cameron! l like to shop! And l dressed up like Jake because l think he's hot! ALL:  You have been a naughty girl, Sharon. Guards, throw my wife in jail! Finn and Jake, thank you for saving my spiky village. No problem, mayor. Now give us a hug.  No! Don't do that! Don't hug us. JAKE: Ow! Hey! Don't touch us!  Ow!  


I'm tired of "Pilgrims of the Land."  I hate that board game.  You're just saying that because Pep But beat you every time.  It's just pilgriming around. There's no point.  There point is building and developing holdings  while trading and acquiring resources.  Yeah, well, nobody ate my guac.  This is homemade, broham.  This ain't no store guac.  You know I love your guac.  Magnifique.  No, this is bad.  Maybe you don't get art.  It's disrespectful to the kingdom's holdings.  It's fresh.  That's illegal!  And beautiful.  What?  Yah!  Aw.  - Hi. - Hey.  - Hey, stop. - No. Wait.  Stop!  Hey!  Hi.  Hello.  You already grabbed me.  You sure?  This this is  - Delinquent vandalism? - A beautiful statement?  Very interesting.  Go back to the barracks  and find out which Banana Guard is responsible for this.  Why don't you just go and ask them yourself?  The Banana Guards are really afraid of getting into trouble.  They love me, but I think they're secretly scared of me.  Here. You can slip in during the changing of the guards.  Not yet.  Three, two, one.  10 whipped cream pies.  That's enough, Banana Guard 12.  Okay, everyone, time for morning calisthenics.  Jump for old colonel.  Yes. Good.  Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!  All right, now, that's enough.  It's time for daily worship.  Gaze upon the divine and terrible countenance.  Please, almighty princess, forgive us.  Sorry, PB.  Yeah, man. Me, too, Prubs.  Come on, bro. Just 10 more reppies.  How the hank are we gonna find out  which one of them is the graffiti fiend?  That's easy, man.  We'll lure him out of hiding with an irresistible temptation,  then trap him.  Watch and learn, rookie.  Good sesh, bro.  Yeah, brothers!  We're all brothers, you know,  fighting crimes and making rhymes, right?  But also how about making a little crime ourselves, right?  I mean, how do we know about crime  if we never done one before?  - Am I right? - That makes sense.  Why don't we meet over by that big, blank wall later tonight  bring a little paint, and see where things go from there?  I don't see anybody, Jake.  They'll be here. Don't worry none.  My plan is good.  Both: What the?  There they are!  Those guys wanted to commit crimes!  No, we  We caught the crime-inals!  I just got that.  Good job, boys.  Just leave them to me.  What the heck, Finn?  I was just trying to shake the bushes, you know?  Lure them out of hiding with an irresistible  Hold up. I already did this bit.  Well, you got to be more subtle next time.  What next time? They know our faces now.  Banana Guards, please welcome these new recruits.  - Hello. - Hello.  Okay, subtle.  Maybe we should split up and just look around  Cover more ground that way.  Now, that's some detective thinking, Finn.  What the? Horse?  Hey, man is there a horse in  - Hey, what was that? - Nothing.  - Swore I heard a - Wha?  Files.  What?  All files.  Please go away.  Okay.  I want back in there now! Come on!  I love you.  Hey, did you see a-a  A something come by here?  No. Just me and this door here.  Yeah. Showers.  Sweet, hot shower to get my head back on straight.  That heavenly singing.  Hey, who's singing in there?!  I like your song.  - Now, hold on a second. - I love you.  Get out of here right now, you.  Some kind of conspiracy is afoot,  but how deep does this rabbit hole goooo?  Hey, man, that's not bad.  It's not that great.  No, it's good, man.  Maybe, though, add some shading  around where the head shadows the neck.  Make sure it's obvious where the light source is coming from.  It'll help give the drawing more volume and depth.  Whoa. You're really good at art, man.  Art.  Could this be the guy?  Gotcha.  Well, bye.  Wait a minute.  Mister?  Banana Guard 16.  You sure know a lot about art and stuff.  Yeah.  Do you have some art of your own I could look off of  and get, um, I don't know, inspiration from?  Inspiration.  Follow me.  In here.  I found this walled off area while cleaning one day.  I like to use it as my, my studio, I guess.  Maybe this will inspire you.  My glob. These are gorgeous.  Hey, thanks.  Is this why you've been painting outside walls, Banana Guard 16? I just needed more space  to express my artistic impulses.  This stuff is great.  You should hang it in a gallery.  No. Princess Bubblegum would hate that.  Banana Guards are just supposed to guard.  She's take me apart to find out what went wrong.  Nah. She's nice, dude.  Nice? Don't you know nothing?  She's an unknowable goddess.  When the first candy people rose against her,  she transformed them into hideous monsters.  Her own brother, Neddy,  she imprisoned him beneath the great tree.  And the rattleball boys?  She iced all those guys.  She's amazing, and she's flipping scary.  But nice.  I never show anybody this place.  If they found me out,  who knows what dark and terrible fate would await me.  But I don't know, man.  I trust you.  We're kindred artistic souls.  Totes.  Ha-ha! Busted!  Slam!  Jake!  Got him in his hidey-hole.  Good work, Finn.  You set me up.  Man, banana guarding is rough.  One rando genetic mutation,  and any one of those dudes would be in the same boat as BG-16.  The same boat.  Oops!  Sorry, man. There you go.  Hey, wait. That's not the same  Banana Guard 16, step forward.  Sorry, PB.  I goofed up. I think we lost him.  I'm Banana Guard 16.  Aw, dude. Come on.  Punish me.  I am ready.  No! I am Banana Guard 16.  I am Banana Guard 16.  - I'm Banana Guard 16. - I'm Banana Guard 16.  Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!  I'm Banana Guard 16.  I'm not gonna punish you, Banana Guard 16.  You're not?  Of course not.  Your murals are so beautiful.  I want you to paint one in the banquet hall.  The princess spared him.  She's so merciful.  Make way!  Merciful princess.  Thank you for sparing your lowly servant.  Buh-buh-buh. No, no, no.  I'm just a person.  I've done things in the past, things I'm not proud of.  But today, I'm here to celebrate.  Princess  I love you.  Wow.  My Banana Guards are so talented.  I grew these hi-da-roponically.  And I can actually play really good.  Um, princess?  Yes?  I don't have a special talent.  That's okay, too.  Hooray!

We need to find him before they give the Oath of Office to Vice President Blowfish. BMO: That creep! Okay, let's go find President Porpoise. I guess we should ask Banana Man if we can borrow his submarine. - Banana Man: No problemo! -  Anything to help the friend of my friend. Uh what are ya doing behind our couch, neighbor? Sometimes I get lonely and need to hear the sound of other people talking. We should let it slide so we can use his sub. But only if I can go with you guys. Nobody steers the S.S. Inquisitive but me! Then it's the three of us! Four!  Ice King: Five! Uh anybody else? Okay, let's go! As soon as I finish loading these supplies, we can ship out. Finn, you're my first mate. Nice. Jake, you're my morale officer. You keep our spirits up while the sub is down. Dude, we're both big-shot officers! What's my job, Finn? You have the most important job of all, BMO To distract Ice King until we get away. That decision was good for morale!  Aah! Hey! You forgot me and the cabin boy here! Hey! Shh! We are on the submarine. What?! No, we're not! Yes, see? Chk, chk, whir. Beep, beep, beep Think we'll see any beautiful mermaids? Get serious, Lieutenant! We're in dangerous waters! Aye-aye, sir! I'm locking in the coordinates for the last-known whereabouts of President Porpoise. Aye-aye, sir! Hey, Jake, do you think I'm doing a good job, like, as a first mate or whatever? Yeah, man, you're doing great Considering we're all gonna die. Wait, what? We're all gonna die. You're supposed to be keepin' our spirits up, remember? Yeah, but it's so cramped in here. Ooh! B.R.B.! Jake? Yeah, man, I'm fine. - I just had to shrink down a little! - What? Look at all this room I have! Ha, cha cha cha Whoa!  Jake?!  I'm good! - What? - Banana Man: Hey, Finn, can you come help me calibrate the windshield wiper fluid valve? Whoa, whoa! Whoa!  I'm good!  What? Look at how small I am.  When did you get so claustrophobic? It's a middle-age thing, I think. Okay, I guess I can calibrate it by myself.  Me, too, huh, guys? You see that?  Will my colleague from the great kelp forest yield? Thank you. The president is missing. Yes, we all agree. And while he is missing, Vice President Blowfish is acting president. Again, yes, agree. But to swear in a new president while the current one is missing? Do not agree! This is an outrage, secretary octopus! Undersea law dictates that when the clock strikes 5:00, I become president! You're not allowed to puff out in the court of food!  Attention, fish parliament! We're here to help! Who and what are you? Jake, get up here! Stuck again! My brother video chats sometimes with the president. I'm a good friend of President Porpoise! Hi. Oh! Aw. Boy, when I first signed up for this adventure, I just wanted to see pretty mermaids. But now I realize it's all about the camaraderie of my fellow sailors, you know? I do know. I had a feeling you'd Hmm. I don't like the look of this. Everything okay, sir? No. We are running out of air.  We need to surface immediately. But if we show ourselves now, the enemy will be right on top of us! Shh!  Finn: Please, just give us a chance! Just make me president! Don't trust these filthy surface boys! I guess it is kind of weird that you guys just showed up and you're not even fish. We're mammals, just like President Porpoise! Yeah, man! Nerves and fur. Oh, that's a good point! Uh, wait! I demand this be put to a vote! Wow, this is intense! Okay, everyone who thinks these guys should just go away, raise your fins or claws or whatever. Two, four, five And with governor anglerfish, that's seven. Oh, eight! Wow. All right, eight. And everyone who wants them to stay and help find the president? No one? Oh, wait. Representative Sybil.  Well, if that's everyone, then the final vote is Wait! I haven't voted yet. Ahh! Ha! There! Now it's nine to eight! The yeas have it. Finn and Jake, you have They must give a 20-minute presentation first! We're on to you, Blowfish!  Stay collected, Lieutenant! We'll get you home to the children you speak of so fondly! It's no good. My guns are barkin'. Pull yourself together, Lieutenant! Slap, slap! I bring my boys home!  Careful, I bruise easily. Finn: You're acting highly sus, V.P. Blowfish! I suspect you may have had a hand in Prez Porp's disappearance!  V.P. Blowfish: You be quiet! You're not right! Okay, guys! I'm going to go look for clues! Something about this whole situation smells fishy! Ah! Ha ha! Whoa!  I'm headed out! Wouldn't say no to company! President Porpoise! President Porpoise? President It's like there's this instruction manual that explains how to talk to people and everyone in the world got a copy except me. Oh!  Just, uh, taking a break. Gonna keep looking! Uh, what?  We've only just met We've barely said a word to each other yet But already I know that We fit Yes, two halves make a whole And wholes are whole Like an arm through a sleeve Or a cup into a movie seat You haven't said a word to me  Only just giggled gleefully  Uh, security!  But already I know that We fit Yeah, we fit You're kissing my space helmet And already I know That two halves make a whole  This has been so nice. But I should probably go help my friends find President Porpoise. Eh, come on, who cares? Oh! But he's your president. National politics don't really represent my interests.  Okay. Talk, Blowfish! Where's the president? I don't know where he is! I'm the president now! Oh, no, bro!  Do not agree!  Huh?! President Porpoise! But where have you A three-day weekend? I don't remember you mentioning that. I tied a string to my tentacle to remind myself? Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope N oh! Well, I'll be! Isn't it always on the last arm you check?  Please, Finn and Jake, when you return to dry land, tell no one of our lax record-keeping. Ah, don't worry, secretary octopus. We wouldn't want to deflate anyone's ego!  Huh?! Ahh! Oh!  My kids must be worried sick!  Man, I can't understand a word you're saying. I said, where's Banana Man? We're getting low on air, and I'm freaking out. Uh, maybe there's a radio or something. Huh? Oh! Oh! Aagh!  You know what, bro? I'm glad you're here. 'Cause dying together sucks a little less than dying alone.


    Do you think it's right for Marceline to invite us to jam without Princess and Beemo? It's just a jam sesh. Is that what you're gonna jam with? Yeah, man. Balloon music is the future. Listen.  Shake your extremities Shake your extremities All your arms and knees I want 'em shakin', baby, please Baby, shake your eyes for me Shake your eyes for me Shake your eyes for me Shake your eyes for free Now make some bills, make duck bills Make 'em ill, quack me up  -  -  With some yolks I like girls who know the ropes I like girls who can cope with the futuristic sound of balloon music  Pretty good. I don't think you've mastered it yet. Well, duh. I just started. Oh, dude. Here's a note. What's it say? "Hey, guys, I had to run out, but I'll be back. Blee bloo blop. Don't go in my house." - That's it? - Yeah. Just "don't go in my house" in all caps -- written in blood. Hmm.  What are you doing? Eliminating desire from my heart. It helps pass the time. Come on. I can't do that. Let's play cloud hunt 'til she gets here. No, man, I got a mental block with cloud hunt. Yeah, that's what makes it awesome -- 'cause I know I'll win. Oh, what?! Bring it on, brother! Now, explain the rules, 'cause I forget. Okay. I count to 10 and you go hide somewhere. Then I got to try to find you. You can hide you can hide anywhere in here. Anywhere in here. But Marcy's house is off-limits, because she said so, okay? - Got it. Okay, I'm gonna start counting. Ready? Yes. Go! One two three four five four Over the mountain the ominous cloud, coming to cover the land in a shroud. Hide in a bushel, a basement, a cave, but when cloud comes a-huntin', no one's a-save! No -- safe. Cloud hunt gotcha! Huh. Hmm. Aha!  Jake! Get out of there! Marceline's gonna kill you! Jake! I know this isn't a mirror! What the -- You're doing it wrong, even! Get out! Get out!  Dude, get out of there! She's gonna kill us! She could be home any minute! Did you read the note?! I mean, you read the note! You told it to me!   Smells like sourdough in here. She's gonna kill us! Once she finds out, she's gonna tie us up and eat us like a spider! You don't think I know that? Hurmmmmm. We'll wait for the right moment and sneak out, right under her big, fat caboose. Okay, man. I can do this.  Shh! Here she comes! - Here she comes! - Shh! Shhh!  Huh.  Let's get outta here!   MARCELINE: Hello?  She didn't wash hands! Is someone here? That's what stinks! Where are those dweebs?   - FINN: This is Jake! - JAKE: And this is Finn!  BOTH: We're not home right now, so leave a message!  Shh. BOTH: leave a message!  Uh y-yeah. Hey, you guys. Are you still coming over? It's jam time, so, like, call me, 'Kay??   Whatcha doin'? Turn around. When she gets this, she'll leave and we can escape. Brilliant! But how's it gonna work? I'll fly the paper as an airplane down the bedroom ladder. It'll triple-barrel-roll past the kitchen, open the fridge and cook some eggs, then eat the eggs and unfold itself as it lays on the carpet in front of Marceline's door. Yeah, yeah! Awesome! Yeah! No! Nu-- nuts!  Well, if they're not gonna show up, then I'll just work on my own stuff, I guess. Take one for new concept album based on 500 years of my journal entries. So here's some preliminary notes. I I want to make this the most emotional album ever -- so private and secret that I'll never let anyone hear. This is so wrong. No one can ever hear it! Ever!  Take one.  Hello, journal, it's me It's been a while since we talked about my life and stuff Let's start with my feelings about my friends  I' Oh, Wait I'  I don't have friends  We've crossed the line! I'm getting out of here, man! Yeah! Do it! MARCELINE:  Because they don't know what it's like to live forever and forget who you even are and what you think about anything How can anyone relate to me when they cannot see what I  My vampire eyes see only blood-red skies Blood-red skies make tears inside that I always hide So I walk alone  Pin?  my mental home  - Wha-- What's it doing?

Hmmmmm  MARCELINE: Hmm.  - Is she awake? - Why are you talking?! I'm wondering if she's awake. Well, if she's awake, she can definitely hear you talking! I'm whispering! Well, now we're both quietly screaming! MARCELINE: I can hear both of you. Disguise yourself, fool!  What are you bozos doing in my lair? Dude, I think she sees us. What the Dude! You shape-changed to look like me?! - Yeah. - MARCELINE: Hey! Exsssplain yourselves.  We were playing hide-and-seek in your closet, and you came home, so we hid in there all day. We saw everything. And, oh, glob! I mean, whatever you do to us, I just want to say we're sorry! So sorry! Okay. Apology accepted. What?! I hide in your house all the time. Anyways, no hard feelings, guys. See you soon. Marceline? Jake?!  Jake! Hm'? Hey, man, did --  


(mouse squeaks) (penguins chirp) (screeches)  (chirping) (keyboard keys clacking) (chirping) Ugh! I'm covered in newbs. (grunts) (guitar plays softly) (speaking korean) - (groans) I've got hunger cranks. - Hmm? Oh, yes! - That's very interesting. - Kim Kil Whan. Rrrrraahh! Mom, when are we gonna eat?! I'm goin' nuts! (speaking korean) Seriously, mom, dad's already three hours late with the food! You hush, junior! You know dad's a wonderful cook. Viola, when's the last time you even heard from dad? Oh, you know. Dad is Distractible. - (laughs) "Distractible!" - Yeah, I love dad and everything, - but he's only ever met me twice. - Charlie, Viola, Tv, Jake Jr, Kim Kil Whan. (speaking korean) (gasps) (laughing) Whoo! - Whoo! Whoo-hoo! - Yeah, yeah, yeah! We're real late! Happy birthday, puppies! Okay, so, putting it out there I didn't remember to bring you guys any birthday presents, but I did bring lunch! It's macaroni salad. - Dad, you're beautiful! - Dad! We have new business to discuss. - Happy birthday, Kim Kil Whan! - Birthdays are old business. Whoa, neat. Um, well, how are things goin', son? "Things"? "Things" have switched hands. (chuckles) - I get it. - Dad, when I say that things have switched hands, I mean to say that things you have previously claimed ownership of have transferred from your hands - to my hands, in that I bought your tree house. - What?! What the deed to your tree house. How acquired through legal trade. From whom the deed's previous owner, Marceline the Vampire Queen. In exchange for one lunatic bass. (bass solo) - When effective immediately. - But, son, why? We will convene at the property. (groans) Sorry I'm late. Okay. So, as the deed holder of this tree house, I am now your landlord. The first thing I'm going to - have to do is assess your treasure room. - But, son, I'm your pop. What would your mother say, doing this to your poor pip-pop! I'm sorry, dad. Deeds don't bleed. Okay, son, get ready to be glitter-stunned by all this treasu Oh, yeah! We spent all of it. All we have left are these vintage photos I got at the flea market. They're interesting! Woof. All right, so, I guess this is the apartment the two of you can afford. It's a ladder. (cellphone rings) Yeah? Yeah. Send them on over. Sorry about that. (clears throat) Anyway, as you can see, this beauty offers direct first and second-floor access, superb craftsmanship, and et cetera. I Suppose you're familiar. - Yes, Finn? - Yeah, when do we get our house back? What? (knock on door) Excuse me. (door opens) Good afternoon. Yes, right this way. I've got 37 available units to show in this building, so we're gonna want to get right to it. Please, step inside. There we go. Is that everyone? Good, good! Please make your way upstairs, and we'll begin the tour. And, you two, go ahead and make yourselves at home. Rent's due on the 1st. No overnight guests. Oh, and flush once after you boom-boom but before you start using the T.P., and then once more in the middle of using the T.P. if you're going to use a lot. It's easier on the pipes. Okay, call me if you need me. (groaning) (sighs) Hey, Finn, I'm real sorry about this. - Somehow, I feel like it's kind of my fault. - Nah, man! It's really not so bad. Let's just sleep on it tonight. - You're gonna sleep like that? - Yeah, man. It's tough. I'm a tough kid. (sighs) I promise I'll work this thi (screams) Gee, but it's great to be back home, eh, Mr. B.? (chuckling) Yeah. I can't wait to wash my gross, fat butt. Ugh! (screams) (tenants snoring) Oh, oh, holy cow! Oh! Oh, boy, please hurry. Yes, he's inside my apartment right now. - Oh, I'm so scared. - Hey, buddy, you okay? - Glob, now there's two of 'em! - I just feel like if we're patient, this whole thing will work itself out before you know it. (siren wails) (laughs) See, man? Help is on the way. (door slams) Man, can I tell you something? I don't even know what's going on, here. I mean, like, what the heck is a deed? How come he can buy our house when it's our house and Marceline gave it to us and we live there? And now we're arrested? - This is crazy! It's crazy! - Man, don't you know? - The laws ain't made to help earthy cats like us. - They're not? Nah, man! Listen. Here on our planet, back in the old days Back in the real old days. It was just every man for hisself, scrooblin' and scrat-scroblin' for the good stuff, the greenest valleys, and scrat-scroblin'. And the strongest, meanest men got the best stuff. They got the green valleys and were like, "the rest of you, y'all scrats get sand." And that's when they made the laws, you see. Once the strong guys got it how they liked it, they said "this is fair now. This is the law." Once they were winning, they changed the rules up. - Whoa, just like Kim Kil Whan. - Hey, good news, fellas. Your bail's paid. You're free to go. (laughs) - That's awesome! - Yeah! Awesome! - Yeah, real "awesome." Hey, Kim Kil Whan! Aw, buddy, I knew you'd come around. (chuckles) Fathers and sons, man. That's that real thick chowder. - (chuckles) What's this? - This is a bill for the bail I just paid. Oh! You're really in it deep, here dad. It's time for you to get real. Get a job. No more games. Come on, son, just let me do the Lah blah blah - (sighs) Man, where did I go wrong? - I don't know, but I'm not tryin' to be sleepin' on a ladder anymore, so let's just get a bunch of scroot together and buy our house back. Then you two can hash it out later. Yeah, you're right. So, wanna rob a bank or somethin'? Well, actually, I was thinking maybe Kim Kil Whan was right. - Maybe we should get jobs or somethin'. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, wait! I just remembered I buried a ton of gold in the front yard! - Yes! - Oh, yes, yes, absolutely. Small pets are allowed with an - additional deposit. - (barks) Excellent. - (Finn laughing in distance) Watch it! - Excuse me. - Almost got it. (clears throat) - Hey, son! I'm glad you're here. Bad news, ya scrat! We're buying our house back! - Oh, yeah? With what? - With this! - Yeah! Oh, I see. With the gold you dug out of my lawn, which is therefore mine. Now, since I have a job, I must be going. Ciao! - And fill in that hole. - I'm gonna be frank, here. - Your son's a real-time jingle-blaster. - I know, I know. Kim Kil Whan's a real out-loud flim-flammer, and that's okay, I guess, but why, why, would he do this to his pip-plop-plop? Oh, wait! You know, like, like, maybe he's got a secret problem he can't tell us about, like with mob goons Like, like gambling - debts or something. - Oh, that's it! You're right! If we help him out of his secret jam, he won't need our money anymore. Look, there he goes now. Come on, let's follow him to the mob goons! You sure this is right, Jake? I've never seen this place before. - Looks like a fairy tale. - Yeah, man, the nose knows. I smelled him go in there And then I smelled him go up there. Whoa! Kim Kil Whan is rich, like wow, like, hello, what? But if he doesn't need our money, what does he need? Throw pebbles at the glass to get his attention. - Hey, son! - Dad? What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. I never even looked for a job. - Really? I was thinking about you buyin' our tree house. I figured out that you don't need our money, so maybe you'd consider my counteroffer Father love! I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you. Come on, open it! It's an ocarina. - I made it for you. - Oh! Whenever you play it, you'll be reminded of your pep-pant's love. Thanks, dad. (deep inhales) Yeah, it's not hollow. I made the holes with the back end of a pencil. (sighs) I suppose I could accept the ocarina as legal trade. The tree house is yours, dad. - Okay. Take care, dad. I'll call. - I'll call! Okay, bye, dad. - Later, son! Yeah! - Yeah, all right! Daddin'! - Sweetheart, how did it go? - Eh, all right, I guess. I don't know. He still lives the life of a child. I mean, it's his choice, but I really thought if he got a job and moved out of that tree house, - it could have put some fire under him. - Aw, I'm sorry, sweets. No, I think I was wrong about dad. I think he's good.


(mouse squeaks) (penguins chirp) (screeches)  (dance music plays, indistinct conversations) Denise, we have concluded you're an interesting and conventionally hot woman. My siblings and I would like to request a date with you. Are you available for a date with Glob on Saturday, Grod on Friday, Grob on Thursday, or Gob on Sunday? Please select your dates now. - Aaaah-oooooh! That's nice. - Eat it, Lich. - Eat it, Lich. - Whooo! (chomping) What?! No more crackers! Eeeeeee! - Prismo! Prismo! Hey, man, hey! - Hey. - Bad news You ran out of cheese crackers. - What?! No. - Yeah, man. What are you gonna do about it? - Jake. (chuckles) I'm Prismo the wishmaster. We can have all the cheesy crackers we want. (laughs) (chomping) Prismo, you make me happy, Prismo. - Oh, stop! - I'm always smiling when I'm around you. I just noticed that. I always am. I'm always smiling when I'm around you, too. (giggles) - This feels so good. - Peppermint butler! Death! - What's up? - Hey, um, those guys are doing selfies on the Lich. - Is that safe? (chuckles) - Definitely gonna send these to Denise. Oh, yeah, that's fine. He's harmless. Yeah, but why isn't he killing everyone in the room right now Controlling our minds, making us rip each other's eyes out while we buttercup one another? Well, the Lich's primary function is to cause mass death, and since he can't do that while he's trapped in my time room, he's stuck in a standstill, like a machine without a purpose. - I'm so scared right now. - Yikes! - Ah, don't worry. He ain't gonna hurt nobody. Ha! You got a cup on your head. Haha! You dingus! (laughs) - See, he's docile as a lamb. - Hmm. Well, okay. - Then I guess I can go for a selfie, too. - Yeah, man, make your dreams come true. (both laugh) Oh! What time is it? - Hey, yo, clockface! What time is it? - It's 12:30. Ah, boo to that. Yo, Prismo, I got to get back before Finn realizes I'm not home. He gets worried if I stay out too long. - All right. Later, dude. - Laters! - Jake, where were you? - I was, uh, in the All right, man. I'm gonna come clean. I've been doing a lot of partying at Prismo's lately. - Come on, man! I don't even take lady up there. - Dude I found out my - human dad is still alive. - Whoa! What? - He's at some place - called the Citadel. - Whoa! Are are you gonna go see him? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't. Maybe there's a good reason he didn't raise me, like he was probably captured by thieves and kept a slave for years. Yeah. Or maybe he was ambushed in the wild and hid you so you wouldn't - be captured, too. - Yeah. Maybe it's better not to rock - the boat. - But it might also be good to find out if you got any genetic risk factors or allergies or whatever. Plus, you get to see what you'll look like as an old guy. Could be cool. (chuckles lightly) I guess it would be okay to meet him, just to know what I'll look like. Cool. Oh! If we hurry, Prismo might still be partying. - Come on! Just one more game. - I don't know, Mang. I was just gonna, like, clean up - and crash out. - Aw, yeah! More play-ahs! (groans) - You guys want to play some card wars? - No. - Prismo, we need to get to the Citadel. - Whoa! You guys do not want to go there Seriously. Check this out. The Citadel is a nastisized prison. Only the worst of the worst end up there. Real stinkfaces. These guys are the pits - The armpits. - Hey, my dad must be, like, the warden there. I know you can't grant me and Finn any more wishes, so we brought Shelby along to wish - on our behalf. - Hello. - Ha! Look at that A little - guy. - So I wish for A pony for my G.F.! - Done. - Shelby! - Sorry, dudes. My girl's been hounding me for a pony for months. I'm gonna mad points for this. (cellphone rings) Oh, hi! Oh, so you got it? That's great. You like him? Uh-huh. You're gonna name him what? - Speedboat? Yeah, that's a good one. - Dang, Shelby. A wish wouldn't have worked anyway. You can only get to the Citadel - committing a cosmic crime. - So, what do we got to do Rob a cosmic bank or steal - a space baby? - Hoo! Uh, I just remembered I got to go home. Got to groom my feathers. Goodbye. Goodbye! Listen, if you guys are serious about this, all you got to do is find a certain sleeping - old man and bring him here. - That's it? - Yep, he's on one of those floating islands out there. It kind of looks like an upside-down duck. - That doesn't seem like much of a crime. - Yeah, but that's all there is - to it For now. - What? - Check it out. - I got gifts for you guys. - Heh! Cool. It's a pen light. Bazoo! Zoooo! Vroom! Jake, don't look directly in the Aaaaah! (energy buzzing) - Oh! Oh, sorry. - Pa-choo! Pa-choo! - Pew! Pew! - Pa-choo! Pa-choo! - Pew! Pew! (clears throat) Come on, Finn. Let's go find this old guy. Oh, one last thing, dudes. Whatever you do, don't wake him up. Okay, you can go now. Pew! Pew! You ever wonder what happened to make a place all wrecked up like - this? - Nope. Hey, upside-down duck! No, wait, it's right side up. Ah-ha! - Hey! Get out here, old man! - Dude, shh! Don't wake him up. Hey, get out here, old man. Bazow! Old man. (mutters) Beep. Beep. Beep. (groans) (hissing) Uh-oh! Finn, a little help. (hissing continues) Bazap! (glass shatters) (groans) (hissing) Hmm. Kazow! (glass shatters, energy) (buzzes) Let's hoof it! (grumbling) Jake, don't jostle the package. (all hissing) Hut! (glass shatters) All right. - Oh! (all hissing) - There's too many of - them! - Let's see here. (energy hums) (steam sizzles) - Oh, hey! You're back. - Dude's got serious - night terrors. - What now, Prismo? - Okay. Wake him up. - What?! - Yeah. I just wanted one last look at - myself. - Wait, this old man is you? That's right. Prismo is nothing but the dream of a wrinkly old man. Man, I've gotten a lot hairier, but also balder. Tell me how that makes any sense. I look like a big, old hairy raisin. - So, wait, what happens to you when we wake him up? - Poof! I'm a goner. - Thus ends mighty Prismo. - Prismo. - Killing a wishmaster is a cosmic crime. Once I'm dead, the guardian will show up and take you to the - Citadel. - I don't think seeing my dad is worth sacrificing your - life. - Ah, don't worry! As soon as my corporeal body - falls asleep again in a thousand years, I'll be back. - You sure about this? Hold on, let me take one last look around. Huh, thought I'd own more stuff - by now. Okay, let's do it. - Still feels like a bad - idea, man. - Psh, what could go wrong? - Wake up. - But wait! I've changed my mind! (gasps) (gasps) Prismo, don't worry! - I'll put the old man to sleep and get you back! - Dude, that means the - Lich jacked our entry into the Citadel! - Aw, no, man! - How you gonna see your dad?! - Hello? Who are you guys? Could any of you strangers tell me how to go home? I'm done with my nap. - Old man Prismo. (breathing heavily) - I just woke up from my nap. Uh But I'm ready to go back to bed. I'd like to go home and take a - nap. - No, old man Prismo. Don't talk to him! Are you my son? (gasps) (growling) Old man Prismo! No! Lich, I'm gonna kill you! (screams) (laughs) (static warbles) (ice creaking) (laughs) (laughing stops) Oh, dang! I think they're going to the Citadel. I'm coming, daddyyy! Wait, wait, wait, wait! (both grunt) Look, Jake, more guardians. The Citadel, I presume. - Likely so. - Hey, do you think maybe one of them could be my dad? Nah, I don't think so. We'll probably know when we see him. Right. Right. That makes sense. (humming) (static warbles) Hey, the Lich, again. This must be where the prison cells be at. See? Good riddance, too. I hope you rot forever, you awful jerk flapper. Some people just make the world a worse place to be, just by being around, Jake. That's right. Bad apples. Lock 'em all up, I say, at the bottom of the ocean, where it's too dark to see. Look at that weird, old kid down there. He looks just like you. - Man, look at his clothes. - Daddyyy! - Wup! (thud!) Aah! All locked up in there. Do you think maybe he's a criminal, too? Well, it had crossed my mind. (groans) Geez, man! I wish I hadn't said all that stuff before. Now my heart feels yellow and green. (groans loudly) (sighs) Maybe we shouldn't even have come here. - Whaaaaaa?! (blowing rapidly) - Jake, what did you do?! - It wasn't me! It came from up there! - Gah! He's melting the crystal all up! Breaking cats out left and right! - Turning cats grey! (roars) - Did he trick us, again? - I think he did. - Hey, kid! (blows) Hey, do me a favor. Get me out of here, huh? This fire smells crazy! (glass shatters) (groans) Thanks, kid. Now, where'd you guys park your starskipper? This place is coming down quick, and I'm talking quick like zip-zip, like wow. - Like boom-boom wow. (whimpers) - Oh, we we don't have - a starskipper. - Also, Finn's your son. - Whaaat?! - No starskipper. (clears throat) - I said, "Finn's your son". - He came a long way to meet you. - Son? Oh! Hey, good for you, kid. In other news, I still got to get out of here, and the ground is melting. - Huh. It's all pooling in the center. - Hey, um, I I wanted - to ask you something. I Well - Hup! Hey, wait up! (muffled) Dad! Wait! (gasps) (both gasping) Dad, I wanted to ask you Whoaaaah! Aaaah! (all groaning, gasping) (coughing) Aah! (energy warbles, train whistle blows) - No! - Gree nah gah bah ga da da brahdada! - Gra gra gra gra bra! (laughs) - Finn, I know we normally come out of these things okay, but I got a bad feeling about this. Just promise me If both my eyes get fried off, you'll fry yours off, too. What? No. Listen, you don't got to worry about a thing, Jake old pal. We just need to defeat those five space villains, hijack the shard they're hijacking, and sail it home to safety. Easy peasy. Yeah, Jake, smarten up. Soon as the last guardian dies, the fighting stops. See? He's biting the dust right now. (screams) (groans) Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh (weakly) - It's Okay. It's okay. - Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh. - Uh-oh, uh-oh. - You just got to fetch me a gob of that guardian blood, son. - It's got that good nooch that keeps us young in the crystal. - Nooch? - Come on, now, partner. No doddling. Your old man needs you. (tink!) (sighs) Attaboy, Flynn! Do it for your old man! Yeah, just get right in there! Don't be shy! (grunting) (splash!) Yeah! Hey, good job, son. Now rub some of that sap on my leg there. Make sure to get it into the chicken-wing hole. (groans) - Dad? - Martin. - Okay, Martin. - We need to talk. - Yeah, okay, kid, but hurry it up. I'm trying to act cool here, but this thing really stings! (inhales deeply) - Why did you abandon me in the forest when I was a little baby? - Oh! I mean (chuckles) - you know me. I'm a funny guy. - Wha Wha (exhales deeply) I don't know. It was a long time ago. Who knows? Like, maybe you left me. (sighs) But, hey, daddy's back! (grunts) You and me, daddy and baby. Or should I say, "baby and daddy"? Now slap that sap. (groans) Uck. Whoa! Would you look at that? Smooth like new. (scoffs) - Couldn't fix the boot, too, huh? - Dude, s'mores important junk happening! Look! (bubbling) It's time to peel bananas on this fool as a family! How about it, Martin? - Dad? - I got to run to the store! (groans) (explosion) Huh? Fall. (groans softly) (laughs) (groans) You are alone, child. (groans) There is only darkness for you, and only death for your people. These ancients are just the beginning. I will command a great and - terrible army. (groaning weakly) - And we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished. You are strong, child. But I am beyond strength. I am the end. And I have come for you, Finn. (groans weakly) (gasps) Gah! (groaning) What? You don't like this stuff, huh? (whimpering) Right in the doorbell. Dad! - Jake, finish off the Lich! I got to go catch my dad! - Dude, forget that - loser! (humming) - Dad! Wait! Hey, cool guys. Looking for a new boss? (tink!) (chomping) Chew faster. That guy's really moving. (rip!) Hyup! Ugh! (groaning) - Dad, stop! - Finn! (groans) - Martin, I won't let you escape! - Hey, hey! You're a void caster, right? We got to put some Gas in this buggy. (energy warbles) Finn, let go! He's not worth it! (screaming) (gasps) Oh, gross! Pedal to the medal. (energy warbles) (screams) (gasps) Hey, what about air It'll be okay, dude. (sighs) I mean, at least you finished off the Lich, right? Oh, yeah, that's the good news. I didn't have to. One sec. Up you go! Check this out. Brand-new baby. The Lich is super cute now, and he smells real neat. That sap rebooted him or something. (lips pop) - I like him a lot. (train whistle blows) - Over here, fellas! Next stop The Candy Kingdom. Previous stop This weird place. Mr. Pig, I think we should get a d (doorbell rings) - Okay, run. Go, go, go! - Oh! Oh, this changes everything! Hello!


     JAKE: If I hear another peep, there's gonna be trouble. Final warning! Okay. Go ahead, bmo.  Okay, welcome back to the program. We're talking with my special guest, finn the human. FINN: Hello. JAKE: Now, finn, before the break, you were saying something interesting -- that you're getting out of the romance biz. So, what happened? FINN: Well, I don't want to bore your listeners  but let's just say the time has come to stop dating princesses and return to saving 'em.  JAKE: And you're not just saying that to, uh, make yourself seem more attractive? FINN: Yeah, of course. No games goin' on here.  JAKE: Hold on, hold on. What's that noise? I think that someone's knocking at the door. JAKE: Can you see who it is? Yes, Jake. JAKE: So it's going pretty good, huh? FINN: Yeah, but maybe we should stop talking about this love junk and get back to adventuring. Finn! Jake! I need your help! It's an emergency! FINN: Now we're talking! Don't cry, slime princess. We're at your service. I need finn to marry me.  FINN: I'm sorry, s.P., but I've given up the dating scene. You don't understand. If I don't get a husband, I'll lose my kingdom. ICE KING: I'll do it! JAKE: What did I tell you?!  Please let me explain. Recently, my much hotter, younger sister, blargatha, married a slime rogue named guillermo. As a result, elder plops decreed that if I was not married by tomorrow, rule of the slime kingdom would pass to my sister, which I'd be, like, totally fine with, except I recently discovered they are both evil. Evil to the core! They plan to militarize the kingdom and begin a campaign of aggressive conquest, sacking our neighboring kingdoms, stealing their resources, and eventually taking over the entire world! JAKE: Ew. Finn, this will happen unless someone marries me. FINN: No. ICE KING: Psst! JAKE:  Please, finn. I know I've crushed on you in the past, but I have no intention of locking this down. Our marriage will only be in name only. FINN: Mm JAKE: Wait! I'm coming, too! I'm gonna eat popcorn and make hilarious jokes. Aw. Who ate all my popcorn? ICE KING:  Call this a room? There's not even a window. Oh, wait. Are we rolling? JAKE:  How much farther? This popcorn's not gonna last all day. All right, now it might. We're here. Welcome to my little oasis in the wasteland. JAKE: Oasis? More like, "no way, sis!"  FINN: Huh? JAKE:  FINN: Whoa! This is amazing! You okay, buddy? JAKE: You could say I got out of there in the "lick" of time. Zing! Quickly. We're already late.  This is the most important place in the kingdom. FINN: The royal palace? No, it's where me and all my main splirts hang out. Hi, girls! ALL: H-I-I-I-I-I!  FINN: Tree trunks and Mr. pig, what are you doing here? Oh, we always come here when we want to shake it, finn. It's the only triple-cray-rated disco in all of ooo. Get your face pretty, finn. My people are already assembled in the courtyard.  Greetings, loyal slimejects!  I would like to introduce my new husband -- finn the human!  What did I tell you? Piece of cake. Attention, my loyal slimejects.  It's blargatha. And that's the mysterious guillermo. He hails from a faraway, much more somber slime kingdom where people have strange customs and no love in their eyes. Their discos aren't even rated one cray. My husband would like to say something. And, uh, he would, too, if not for his extremely sore throat, so I will say it for him. We challenge you to the trials of glarb.  I object! Ancient traditions such as the trials of glarb are no longer relevant in our modern self-indulgent society. Order! Order! I demand order! I, elder plops, being the coolest guy in the room, will settle this dispute. The matter will be settled on the battleground FINN: All right! the battleground of love. FINN: Aw! The couple that I deem most truly in love shall rule the slime kingdom for life.  Plops out.  FINN:  JAKE: This is, like, the opposite of what you wanted. Welcome, everyone, to the trials of glarb, hosted by me, elder plops. The first trial will be crooning. You guys are gonna get into these sweet boats I made and croon for each other on the lake. The most loving and heartfelt song, judged by me, elder plops, will win. I really want to hear some emotional song work here. The people want to hear emotional stuff. So let's see some stuff, all right? Okay, finn, you can do it. FINN: I don't know. I'm still jacked up over my lady biz. Well, just lose yourself in your own mind and go numb. Then let it all out. FINN: Okay. Just let it all out.  When I'm heating up my lunch or delivering a dungeon punch I can't get over you your kiss is burned into my brain Simon's hair is clogging up my drain I just can't get over you see your face all over ooo sticks to me like a coat of glue I can't get over you  Why can't I get over you? Finn, way to go. I could tell the people were really impressed. Guillermo, you're up. Hmm? Okay, guillermo. I'll ask, I'll ask Guillermo still has a sore throat! May I sing on, uh, his behalf? Elder plops thinks that's okay.  I want to touch your hand with my hand I want to rub your cheek with my cheek maybe later we can get "do not disturb"  I'm done! As elder plops, I have heard many songs in my life, and I can only say this Finn, you win this one. FINN: Whoo! Yes!  Welcome, everyone, to our second trial Spooning. When I say go, the big spoon will put his arm around the little spoon and cuddle. I will be watching you spoon, measuring and assessing your love by posture and overall vibe. The best cuddle, or spoon, wins. FINN: Wait. What? JAKE:  Spooners, get in your futons. FINN: Uh, I don't feel good about this. Ready, set Spoon! FINN:  No, wait. I don't want to do this! Wrap those gorgeous pythons around me! FINN: No! This feels weird! Come on, finn, they're crushing us! Wuh! Wuh! Wuh! Blargatha and guillermo, very nice. FINN: Nooooooooooooooooo! Yeesh. All right, everyone, stop. I've seen enough. Blargatha and guillermo's love was way-off-the-charts good. They win. Yes! I love you, baby. You spoon so good! FINN:  No! The score is tied. There's one more trial after spooning and crooning -- smooching. I'm sorry it doesn't rhyme with crooning and spooning. We will begin our next trial on the morrow!  This is not going well. FINN: I'm sorry, slime princess. I'm just going to mess this next trial up. Is it because you haven't done much kissing? You don't have to be embarrassed by your innocence. FINN: Pretending to be in love is making me sad. It makes me think about flame princess. What if I pretend to be your ex? FINN: That's worse, I think. Well, it looks like I'm losing my kingdom to the forces of evil. FINN:  No, slime princess. Let's practice this smooch. Mmmmm. FINN: I'm sorry. I -- I can't!  Bunk this! Wait! Where are you going? FINN: I'm going to punch guillermo in his stupid face till he agrees to leave the kingdom. I want to come! FINN:  Hey, guillermo! Can you come out here for a Quick meeting? JAKE: More like a quick beating. Hey-o! He says eat a fat dollop and buzz off! Blargatha! FINN: Hyup! Hmm.  Finn, you shouldn't break in to a woman's room. FINN: Hyah! Everyone okay? JAKE: Yes. "Tank" you. FINN: Hyah! Eh? FINN: Guillermo! Hyah!  Are you dead, man? Aw, geez, bro. Huh? These are olives. Uh-oh. Blargatha, why would you make a fake husband? You're so hot! You don't know how hard it is to be this hot. Women don't want to talk to you because they're intimidated, and guys don't want to talk to you because they're too scared. You're alone in the hottest, most sexiest prison. So I stuck some olives on a glop of gelatin and called him my lover. FINN: Well, I'm sorry, blargatha, but you're going to have to spend more time in your metaphorical prison in a real prison, 'cause what you're doing is illegal. Uh, no, it just disqualifies her from challenging me. FINN: Whoops.  By the authority of elder plops, I officially declare You are still the slime princess. ALL: Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Finn, what do you think? FINN: I don't want to disappoint all these people.  I'm sorry! I can't do it!    FINN: What Is the meaning of soup? JAKE: What? I don't know. What's with all the weird quest-- FINN: What is the meaning of spoon? JAKE: Shoot, man. Are you still lady-sad about flame princess? You know, it's okay if you are. FINN: Nah. That's all fine. I've just been feeling kind of gray, is all. Like, my inside voice has been kind of quiet lately, not a lot of instructions forthcoming, you know? JAKE: Yeah, well, sounds like you're sad. Listen, finn. Girls is like horses -- when you fall down, it's important that you get right back on again On a different horse. And there's a lot of fish in the sea, a lot of fish. A penny saved is a penny earned. FINN: YeahI-I guess. Or maybe dating girls is like riding a bicycle JAKE: Yeah, man, yeah! FINN: Where, like, if you mess up, you can get really hurt forever or hurt someone you really care about. JAKE: Uh, well, I suppose. Anyway, I hope this mystery cave we're looking for is as weird as flambo's brother says it is. Maybe that'll snap you out of the -- whoa! What?! What's this train all about? No one said nothing about no train in the way. FINN: Relax, buddy. We'll just cross after it passes. No big thing, really. JAKE: Oh, yeah. It's two hours later now. What the stonk? Oh. Okay. Hey, the train just goes in a big circle. We can cut right through the middle. Blingle, blongle, bloongle. Come on. Hey, you know, I just had another idea. If we just stay put here on the train, we can ride it all the way to the cave. Blingle, blongle, bloongle! Hyah! Give me -- give me the loot! FINN: Ow! Yow! Come on, give it! Give me that hat! FINN: Knock it off. Aah! Whoa, dang! FINN:  JAKE: Hey, finn! FINN: Whoa. JAKE: Look at all the loot that guy dropped while you whipped his butt. FINN: Dang. Look at that sword. Whoa. It feels kind of right. Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh, whoosh. Whoosh!  Whoa. JAKE:  It's pretty fun, huh? FINN: Yeah, man! It's spicy baby fun! JAKE: You want to go see what other kind of monsters are on this train? FINN: Yes! JAKE:  FINN: Whoa. Crystal ants, I think. JAKE:  Cool.  FINN:  Yeah!  Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!  Ha! JAKE:  Welcome back, buddy. FINN: Man, look at all this rad loot. JAKE: Yeah, this is a pretty neat train. We should come back again someday. FINN: Wow, what do you mean? We just started only like three hours ago. JAKE:  YeahI-I'm just getting a little bored, is all. All these cars and monsters are kind of all the same. It's a little boring. FINN: Oh, come on. It's fun. Just one more car. Come on. Come on, man. Come on! JAKE: All right. Just one more. FINN:  Yes! JAKE:  FINN: Hmm? Where is everybody? JAKE: Hey, hey! Empty car. I think we beat it, buddy.  FINN: Whoa, man. Boss battle! Let's chew it up! JAKE: Okay, but this is the last one, okay? FINN: We'll see!  JAKE: Hey, man. Remember we were going to that weird cave? I bet it's not too late to check it out. FINN: Eh, weird cave, weird train. I'm cool here. JAKE:  Okay. FINN: Hyah! Aah! Give me a break! FINN: Oh? Oh, dang. Boss loot! Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm. Oh, yes. JAKE: No, thank you. FINN: Jake, hurry! Next car! Slime crimes! JAKE: You have fun. I'm just gonna watch. FINN: Yeah! Huh! Ugh! Hey! Ow!  Ow. Cool. Acid.  Hey, also, man, aren't you, like, getting kind of hungry? FINN: Yeah, man. I guess we've been here for a while. JAKE: More than a while, dude. I've already missed my bathroom window. FINN: Yeah, I guess I could take a snack break. JAKE: Okay. Well, we'll go back to the tree house, and I'll make us some lunch. I could make the toaster pancakes you like. Or maybe I can boil up some hot dogs. Or -- FINN:  Look, now we don't got to do that thing you wanted to do. JAKE: Aah! FINN: Hot meat! JAKE: Ants again?! FINN: Ant no thang! Hyah! Caught with your ants down! Ants for nothing! Forget about ants. What's wrong? Feeling antsy?! JAKE:  Dude, this is the ant car. We already did the ant car. You did all the ants. FINN: Same car -- ugh -- but those were blue ants. These are red ants. JAKE: Finn, I think we should take off. I think this place is bad news for you. FINN: Man, no way. All this feels good, like my inside voice is saying, "hey, keep it up. This is good stuff." Aah! Hey! Hyah! Like when you made those biscuits way back and I kept eating them until they were all gone, like that. JAKE: Finn! I made those biscuits with so much butter. You were just responding to the butter! This whole place is butter! FINN: Yeah! Boss fight! Yeah!  Hyah!  My junk and stuff! FINN: Check it out. Battle moon. JAKE: What?  Finn, this is a future crystal! Look! That's you, dude. You're old, you're alone, and you're still fighting on this dumb train. OLD FINN: Get ant of town. FINN: Whoa. I'm gonna have the best life. Oh! Hair apes! JAKE: Nah, dude. I'm bored, I'm tired, and I'm going backTo the tree house. You can come with me if you want. FINN: What? No, man. It's better on the train. Stuff makes sense here.  FINN: Ow!  JAKE: I'm sorry. If you wish to join me, I'll be in the tree house, experiencing the joys of life and not getting attacked by gorillas made out of hair. FINN: You'll be back. JAKE: No, I won't, finn. Goodbye! FINN: Huh.  FINN: Hey!  Hair we go! JAKE: Hey, what are you doing up here? Whoop. JAKE: Are you getting sick of things down there, too? Whoo. JAKE: Mm-hmm. You're not gonna try and zap me, are you? I wonder what my kids are doing.  Hey. I knew it. Got to find that kid. Hey, finn! F-- whoa. UmHey, there, friend. I ain't looking for no trouble. I'm just looking for my friend finn. Maybe you've seen him? About five feet tall, picks his nose, and always kind of smells funny l-- FINN: Hey. Hey. Jake, it's me. I'm just all souped up now. JAKE: Ah, geez, finn. I -- for a minute there, I thought you were one of those twisted, lost-soul, boss guys. FINN: LA, LA, LA. JAKE: Wait. You are! You are one! FINN: What? Those guys are cool. JAKE: That's it, man. I'm getting you off this train whether you like it or not. FINN: Jake, stay back. I mean it. JAKE: Oh, please. What are you gonna do? I'm 10 times stronger th-- hey!  FINN:  JAKE: Oh, gross.  FINN: Yoink! Jake, trying to tell me what to do. Yeah, right. I tells me what to do. Now, let's see what we got here. Apple, apple, chicken, apple. Oh, yeah. That little orb in which I rule. Let's see that again, orb. Yeah. That's right. Looking right.  Wait a second. Who's that sad, bored little guy following me around? Jake? All those years, he stayed with me. OLD JAKE: Finn, can we slow down? My feet hurt. OLD FINN: What? FINN: Oh, Jake. Hang in there, buddy. I'm gonna set this right. JAKE: Finn! Finn, I'm sorry. I'll stay on the train with you. I swear. Just get this stuff off of me. FINN: No, I'm sorry, Jake. I messed up. But don't worry. It's all over now. JAKE: You mean, we're getting off the train? FINN: WellYou are. I'm gonna keep playing for a while. I'll meet you back home in a week or two. JAKE: Oh, man. Don't you see that's just the train talking? It's got its hooks in you. FINN: No. No, for real. My inside voice is telling me it's time. Here. See for yourself. JAKE: Yeah, man. That's what I'm talking about. That is what I'm talking about.  


-  -  -  -  -  - Finn: Jake. So, I just had this weird thought. Jake: Well, that's normal. People always have weird thoughts around campfires. Finn: Well, I don't know. Isn't it sort of strange that we keep pets? We kind of make them worship us. Jake: What? Nah. Finn: No, seriously. Think about it. We're their only source of food and water and, like, tummy rubs. They basically have to love us. Jake: What's wrong with tummy rubs? Finn: Yeah, tummy rubs are pretty great.  That one star is so crazy. Look like it's vibrating. It's so cool. Wonder what it is. A planet?  Do people live there? Are they friendly? Do they keep pets? Jake: All right, buddy. That's a little too much campfire. - Time for bed. -  Finn: Whoa. Holy Oh, dang. Uh Okay. Man, this is screwy. Maybe it's the can of beans we had for dinner. Looks, uh Homey. Whu-oh.  Oh, right. Mm. Boobafina. Uh, just pay me back when you can. - Finn: Aww! Hello. - Finn: Huh?! Oh, hey! - You can see me? - See you But if I didn't see you Wait. What did you originally ask me? Finn: Aw, forget it. It's cool. Do you Want a drink or something? - Think I only have water, anyway. - Finn: Whoop! Here I go. Bye. Oh. That was sort of rude. I hope he comes back. Finn: That guy seemed lonely. Not a lot of other foxes up at this hour. Guess you get a lot of work done, though.  Quittin' time.  You don't have to go home, but you  You know how it goes. Finn: Bounce House Princess.  - Finn: I didn't know B.H.P. lived in a cave. -  - Finn: Hey, this place is pretty nice. -  - Finn: Whoa. - 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, - 47, 48, 49, 50! 51, 52 - Who's there? -  -  Oh, oh! Oh, my glob! Oh, my glob! Oh, my glob, oh, my glob, oh, my glob! -  - - Six, four, three, two. - Finn: Dude, what's your deal? -  - Everything's okay now. - - Finn: Aw, geez. Poor Bounce House Princess. -  - Finn: Huh?  -  - -  - Bounce House Princess, you listen to me. Are you gonna shut yourself off from other people forever? - I mean, he or she could be really nice and -  Okay. M maybe if I just stay very still it'll just - it'll just go away. -  Finn: Gosh. I hope B.H.P.'s okay. Feel bad for just splittin' like that. Maybe they sorted it out. They could have stuff in common. You never know until you speak to the person. -  - Oh, hey, Cloud Kingdom.  What the Ice King? -  - Ice King: Yeah, I guess there's some cool people here. Music's a little loud, but the punch is top-drawer. Mm-hmm. Ice King: Hey, you should come to one of my parties sometime. I'm friends with some pretty cool people, too, you know? Uh-huh. Who are your friends? Ice King: Oh, uh, - like that guy Finn? - Finn? Ice King: Yeah, Finn and I are pretty tight. Finn:  -  - Hmm. Oh, hi. Are you the ice dude? Ice King: That's me ice dude. Say, have you ever seen the inside of an ice-bear cave? Did you say you know Finn the human?  Hey, buddy! Buddy, care to freshen me up? Ice King: Yeah, yeah, now scram. Hey, is Finn seeing anyone right now? Could you introduce us?  Oh, my glob, is he here now? Ice King: So I guess you're more into the little-brother type, huh? Hey, Lauren. I heard your grandpa's giving out ice. -  - Ice King:  Ice?! I'll give you ice! Ah, looks like I put this party "on ice." No wait. "You want ice? You oh, you got iced." Anyway. Ai! Aw, don't look at me like that, Lauren. Aw, this party was weak anyway. Finn: Poor Simon. Poor Simon, I guess? Poor Simon, sort of? It's like some part of him wants to be a sad wong lord. But why would anyone want that? Is there some incentive? -  - What the  What can I do? time will unbind our memory glue and I'll be as nobody-ish as all of you so don't care about a thing now like a trash bag when it's windy out like a butt that has a face Dutch boxing up the palace yeah, girl, it sti-inks do, do, do, do, do, do, do  Finn: Sheesh. I wonder if being a sad loner gives you more raw materials to form song ideas. Is that where creativity comes from? From sad biz? I am so high up now. I'm so high up there is no high up. It's all just Whoa. What the Whoa! Space lards! Aw, man. Jake would be flipping out, trying to get that super-rare milk. Make a sick flan with that milk. Oh, well. ( ( Whoa. What's going on? You can't see me, right? -  - Whoooooooa!  I'm in the mother lard!  What? Space birth. Whoa-kay. Here we go. Whoa! Bye, guys. Well, that was creative, and it wasn't sad, either. So maybe birth is the greatest creative statement in all the universe. Hey, baby. - You gonna give me a boost? -  -  - Whoa! -  - Whoo-hoo! Here comes Mars. What the heck is going on, though? -  - Everybody's leaving. -  Fire defense missiles. - Missiles away. Impact with catalyst comet in five, four, three, two, one Yes. Do you think it worked, Starman? Uh, yeah, probably, right? Shoot! No effect! It's still coming right at us! Was that all of our missiles? Uh, yeah. I'm surprised we even had those ones. Like, who would we shoot a missile at? - Who would we shoot at? - I'm thinking, Starman. Whoops. Grob, assessment.  We're sunk, bro. This whole place is gonna be a stinking, molten dump in a minute. It doesn't make sense. Every 1,000 years, the catalyst comet mysteriously reincarnates itself and collides with Earth, bringing with it an agent of change, but the comet's never been so off schedule, and it's never freaking hit Mars. - What do you think, Finn the human? - Finn: What? Who? Me? You can see me, too? - Yes. I am Glob. - Finn: Oh, yeah. Hey, do you ever say, "oh, my" glob"? No, but sometimes gob does. Finn:  You're dreaming so far from home. - It must be comet-related. - Finn: Yeah. - But I got a question. - What's that? Finn: Well, if just being born is the greatest act of creation, then what are you supposed to do after that? Isn't everything that comes next sort of a disappointment slowly entropying until we deflate into a pile of mush? Well, it's not enough to have created something amazing, right? What if I just let my Martian super-society go to butt? Finn: But what's it worth if we all gonna get blowed up right now? Whoa! What are you doing?!  Finn: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!  Oh, my blood! Finn: What is it, boy? Finn: Glob is dead. Hello, Starman. This is Evacuation Man. What's the sitch? - Can we go back yet? - Yes. Gob/Glob/Grod/Grob diverted the comet. - It's back on its normal path to Earth. - And - What about the G-man? - No sign of Glob. Aaaaaaaaaaahh! Computer! What did we hit?!  Ohh! Ugh. Plops. Ugh. Oh, for real plops. Finn: Hey, I think Bounce House Princess needs our help. Jake: Let's do it.


Credits and bs I remember you. Okay, Gunther. You ready for the show to begin? One, two, three Gunther, why did you Gunt my fries? I gunted them, and they were mine. What kind of Gunt Gunts his Gunther's fries? And doesn't even Gunt him in the eyes. Gunther there were tears there. If you Gunted them would you even care? Gunther, do you even love me? It's rethorical, Gunther. Marceline's songs are so good. Maybe I can get Marceline to write a song with me. Man, if she helped me write a song like that, I'd be crushing it non stop with the princesses. Oh, yeah! Gunther, you cute little dummie. You know, Gunther? My song is gonna need some dope lyrics to lure the honeys in. Jay T. Dawgzone always says ladies are drawn to bros with tortured pasts. And I got a way tortured past. I think. I don't really re Quickly, Gunther. To the "the past room". Oh, yes. Lot of emotionally powerful stuff in here. It's still wet with tears. I'll take some of this for lyrical inspiration. So, where's Marceline living this days? A cave? Well, well, well. Looks like Ice king is up to bad biscuits brother. Bad biscuits make the baker broke, bro. Ice king, you make our job too easy. You ready to roll on this fool? Do the roll! Hello? Anybody home? No. What are you doing here? I told you not to come around me. Yeah, I know. But I was hoping you could help me write a song. One that could help me get some princess action. I'm not gonna help you pick up on chicks! Come on! We can be a prog rock duo! I'll even split the fans with you. I get the princesses and you get whatever it is you're into. Sounds good, yeah, I think it does. Hey, get out of here! Wait, just let me play you what I've written so far. Oh, dang it, tangles in the cord. Sometimes this happens when you fly with it. Tangles are hard. Oh geez, no. Oh, no. Ice kings' in trouble. Hey you know what? I'll just hum it for you. Is that good? Ice king! Whaaa? Oh, you got him. Nice job, Marceline. Your constant harrasement of the female gender makes me sick. No, he can stay. What? Yeah, what? It's all right, we're working on a song together. You don't want us to for you? No, it's okay, you guys can go. Okay Well I guess we'll see you, then. - Bye. - Bye. You know? I kind of like being tied up in this cords. Kind of fruity. So, what kind of song are we playing? Oh, I brought these for some inspiration. I'll just use this to work off a, you know, a template. Okay. Yeah, that's good, keep doing that.  Slime princess, you're all right. Flame princess, you're okay. Wild berry princess could be better. All of the princesses are pretty all right, but, oh, Bubblegum, you look like a lot of fun. I write outside, and that is how I know. Hey, princess did you get my text with the picture of my awesome gun show? I'm also working on my pecs. If you'd like I'll send you a picture of that too. Oh, Bubblegum, I really need someone. Or anyone. Pretty much anyone. I'm so alone. Won't somebody tell me what's wrong with me? Anybody?  Grob in the sky, please tell me why! Stop acting like this! No! It's just starting to get good! Anybody! Princesses, I command you! Love me! Love me! Love me. Love me. Stop acting crazy. I just wanna be loved! I'm sorry I pushed you. I'll just stay out of your way. Again, I'm sorry I pushed you. What you got? An apple?  You're so annoying, you pitiful old man. I'd like to help you, but I don't know if I can. I thought you were nuts. But you're really really really nuts. Everytime I move, eventually you find me and start hanging around. Just another lame excuse to see me, man, it's getting me down. You know? I'm actually glad to see you. Maybe I'm the one who's  nuts. Hold on. Do you like me? Of course I do, you old jerk! Really? How about one of this? Not like that! You don't remember anything, do you, Simon? What-mon? Why do you even come see me when you don't remember me? You don't even know who you are. Yes I do. I am a lyricist. It's all here, on the page. The page in song, baby. On this receipt, on this take out menu, on this newspapers. Look, this clipping this was you, Simon, before the war. This! You took this picture. You scribbled all over it. Oh, oh, are they good lyrics? I'll get the keyboard. What? Wait, listen! Yeah, let's go! What does it say? Sing out, sister.  Marceline, is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world? That must be so confusing for a little girl. And I know you're going to need me here with you, but I'm losing myself and I'm affraid you're gonna lose me too.  Ooh, yeah! Keep it going!  This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me crazy, and I need to save you, but who's going to save me? Please forgive me for whatever I do when I don't remember you.  Wow, I love that. Hot stuff. What? You don't remember what it means? Look!  Marceline, I can feel myself sliping away. I can't remember what it made me say, but I remember that I saw you frown. I swear it wasn't me, it was the crown. This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me crazy. And I need to save you, but who's going to save me? Please, forgive me for  What is going on in there? I have no idea.  Please forgive me for whatever I do, when I don't remember you.


Oh, geez. Oh, geez. Ugh, come on. Uh Come on. Come on. Finn, don't worry about it. We've got bigger fish to fry right now. But It's fine. Pep But used to love being scattered all around. - He used to tell me that. - Lies! Those farmers won't keep this thing busy for long. So it's up to the four of us to stop him. Are you ready, Marceline? Marceline? Hey, what's wrong? Me, I guess. - What? - Me. I'm wrong. This all of this! This is all my fault. Even just fighting the vampires in the first place screwed everything up. Sure screwed me up, anyway. And, geez Louise, trying to fix it Trying to fix me Just made things a thousand times worse so why even try, you know? What's the point? What? Marceline, no. Come on! We're always the underdogs, you and me, and we always pull through. Like that one time, you remember? - The case of the Purloined Egg? - No! I told you, that's it. I'm done. All right people, this is our last stand! It's gonna take every one of us to see this thing through Me, Onion Man, Short Man, Terry whoa! Short-Stack, Good-Beard, Deshawn, Seedman, Sandwich Paul, Angry Susan - Muy Linda, Dr. belstar - Help! Limbo Man, Quasar, Dogman, Tightwad, Raspberry Sam - Up here! - Deejay Fresh-Start, and my boy Big Trace. You sure you're not coming, Marceline? We could really use your help. Marceline? Okay, maybe later then. Come on, Finn! Let me hear that war cry! Well, you finally did it, big guy. You won. Well played. I just kind of wish you would gotten it over with a thousand years ago and saved us all some trouble. Better late than never, I guess.  Smelled something bad Just a sec, now it's gone Was it there all along? Smelled like garbage and cheese Was it just on the breeze? Or was it me?  -  Was it reality?  - Ice King:  Was it reality?  You remembered my song! Simon? W-what are you doing here? Well, I saw through my peeping scope that everything was going boom and exploding and monsters, and all my friends were in grave danger and horrible torment. And you wanted to help? No! I felt left out. I'm just a phone call away, you know. I'm sorry, Simon. Next time, for sure. Anyway, you don't want in on this fight. - This one's a loser. - Oh, I see. Sittin' this one out, huh? Yeah, I guess. And don't try to talk me out of it. What? No, no, I'm right there with you. You and me We're survivors, right? Like cockroaches or rats. Sure, you could fight and try to save the day, but what if you lose? Then what? You could die. Better to run and hide like a rat, right, buddy?! Ugh! Did you just call me a cockroach, Simon?! What? No! No, no, no, no. - Thanks, buddy. - Yes. Ahh, this is nice. Getting a little warm for royal fineries, though. Mm-hmm! Princess? It sounds pretty bad out there. Perhaps you should protect your people. Yeesh, it does sound bad! Hey, Banana Men, listen to your princess! In my kingdom, we look after our own me! You look after me. Close the gates! Aah! S-she's beautiful. You're preaching to the preacher, brother. I'm beautiful. Close the gate! No. You're not beautiful. We see you clearly now. You're Earwax! You're Earwax! Aah! Huh?! And the power returns to Crunchy! Aah! But you love m-e-e-e-e! And instead of a wax idol, they shall have a true princess Wrought of Iron, with teeth of diamonds. Her heart is ice! Her will is fire! Princess Crunchy, the unforgiving! Go fight that thing for me! Whoa! Finn, this ain't workin'. It's just fart grabbin'. Yeah, but what else can we do? Dudes, I don't know. Look! Whoa! I'm gonna poop my pants if Finn kills this guy instead of me! Wha?! King? Vampire King? You still in here? Hello? Too bad. Oh, boy! Ooh, I am famished! The beast weakens! Whoa-ho-ho. Whoa! Marceline? Marceline? Marceline? Marceline? Marceline? Sorry, what? I was just saying we stocked your fridge with lipstick and stuff, so you'll have lots to eat. Aww, thanks, dude. Also, we got you crosswords, soo-doo-koos, and connect-the-dots. Just take her easy, buddy. Sure. Oh, hey, I was thinking So, once I usurp Crunchy, I'll have my castle back again, and there's plenty of room there if you don't want to be alone. No, I think I need to ruminate a little Think about being a vampire again. Are you, uh Do you feel bad? I don't want to say, like, "I'm sorry about who you are" or anything if you're feeling okay, but I don't know how bad news all of this is Right? Nah, I'm cool being a vampire again. Being mortal was good. At the same time, it was terrifying. Now I'm a vampire with fresh mortal memories and I don't know More empathy or something More grown-up. Bonnie, thank you for helping me grow up. Now, I guess we get to hang out together forever. - Take care! - See ya, Marci! Later, Vampire Queen! Your friends seem nice. Um are you, like, in my head now, or what? For now. Well, just don't get in my wa  Let's go in the garden You'll find something waiting Right there where you left it, lying upside down When you finally find it You'll see how it's faded The underside is lighter When you turn it around Everything stays Right where you left it Everything stays But it still changes Ever so slightly Daily and nightly In little ways When everything stays


1   I can't believe I let you talk me into this.  It's not like I have a lot of free time, you know.  Peebs, you work too much.  Imagine a pizza.  Only half should be business.  The rest should be personal.  Personal pizza.  Yuck.  Try to have fun tonight.  With the Ice King?  Not in your everlasting lifetime, girlfriend.  I wish you'd call him Simon.  He's actually kind of sweet and funny.  Can you please try to get along tonight?  It would mean a lot to me.  I'll try.  Try anything once, that's what I say.  Simon!  What's this?  It's a present.  To bribe you for coming over.  You don't have to bribe us, silly.  We're here because we want to hang out with you.  No one has ever said that to me before.  You didn't say, "No take backs."  Bottoms down.  So, check it out!  I upgraded my home karaoke system.  Do you like karaoke?  Duh! We love karaoke.  Bonnie is a dynamo on the mike!  Okay. You guys get started, I'll freshen up PB's drink.  Marceline?  Irslerskat prjon!  Prjon, prjon  Prrrrrrrrrrrrjon!  Marceline! Get out here quick!  What's going on?  Something's wrong with the I.K.  No! Simon!  Hi, Marceline.  Are you guys pranking me?  Your friend just majorly malfunctioned!  He was jerking around all weird,  and his voice sounded like he was possessed!  Cool out, B-Bell.  I know you love karaoke, but you can't take it so seriously.  I hope you like penguin cuisine.  It's mostly just shapes.  Who doesn't love a good rhomboid?  You're a rhomboid.  Here, Simon.  I know these are your favos.  Thanks, Gunther!  He just called you "Gunther."  He calls everybody Gunther.  Bonnie!  There's something really wrong with Simon.  There's some wrong with Wait.  You just called him Simon.  Call me whatever you want.  This is the best date I've been on since my last date.  This is not a date.  Neither was the last one.  It was a robbery.  For real?  Yeah. She stole my heart.  And my crown.  Your crown.  Crubs! He's really flipping out!  What'd you do that for?!  It just makes things easier.  I'm definitely seeing some weird activity here.  It's really, really  You don't know what's going on.  Maybe I can access it with my VR equipment.  Whoa, Bon-bon!  This stuff is rad.  Why haven't you shown me before?  I didn't think you liked science.  I like games.  We can play sometime.  But this time, it's business.  Whoa.  This is not what I was expecting.  Did you press the wrong button?  I never press the wrong button.  Yeah, you always know which button to press.  I'm referring to the fact that you know how to annoy me.  Yeah, I got that.  What I don't get is this stupid scenery.  At least it's got a pretty killer beat.  Wow! Two newbies at the same time!  How'd you manage that?  Yeah, okay.  I guess if you really squeeze together, it could fit you both.  Who are you?!  Are you a dinosaur?  I'm a Gunther.  Okay, what's a dinosaur doing here?  I'm practicing my drums.  The others say the acoustics out here are better than in town.  What the bleep?!  Yeah. That's been happening lately.  You're lucky you didn't get rearranged.  Ooof!  Does this circuit look infected to you?  I don't know. I only deal in infectious grooves.  Sounds like you guys need another brain.  I'm gonna take you guys to the the professor!  He's the smartest guy I know.  Next to Master Evergreen, of course.  - Prjon. - Hey, guys.  Prjon. Hey, Goontz!  Who are those dudes?  That's Sveinn.  He only wore the crown once.  And the guy next to him says he's the first "Santa."  Like, what's even a "Santa"?  Dude, the Santa?  Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.  Aha! There he is!  Professor Petrikov!  Simon!  Marcy!  Dear! How is this possible?  Did my beloved Betty master the secrets of the crown?  No. Bonnibel scienced us in.  You must be Betty's little assistant.  Assistant?!  I have been my own boss my entire life.  I built my own lab!  I've created freaking life forms!  Okay!  Actually, I haven't seen Betty since she came back to Ooo.  But if Betty didn't send you, why are you here?  The crown is going ba-nay-nays.  It's making Ice King act super weird in the real world.  Yes, I see.  It seems to have infected much of the crown's labyrinth.  I was actually just about to follow its path of destruction.  A quest!  Hey, Marcy, last time,  I was so caught up in making things right with Betty  that you got left out.  I'm sorry.  It's okay. I get it.  So, you got a boyfriend yet?  Ha! No.  There was this guy once,  but he was a real jerk, so I dumped him hard.  Wish I'd been there to punch his face.  Simon!  I can punch my own jerks now.  It's getting pretty bad. I think we're close.  Yeah! Can't you hear my intense drumming?  Magic Man?  Magic Woman.  Betty!  This is the fabled Betty?  I always pictured her more majestic.  You know, with, guts and stuff.  Betty, please, what are you doing?  I'm re-programming the crown's wish magic.  Got to fix Simon.  A-ha!  I'm a bush!  It's just on backwards.  Betty's the one who's backwards.  We got to get her malware out of here  before she causes irreparable damage.  Now!  - Now! - Hoo!  Now! Aaah!  There has to be a part of the real Betty  in there somewhere, Gunther.  If only I could reach out to her.  Okay. Get in there and reach.  I think I will.  Betty?  I'm the reason you're doing all this.  I'm busy.  Remember how we met?  When we both reached for the same book in the library,  and I said you should check it out first?  And when you returned it, you left a note inside,  because you knew I'd borrow it next?  It was the funniest, smartest note I've ever read.  Ihave to work.  Betty, I love you so much, but you can't help me like this.  I can and I will help you, Simon!  You remember me!  I-I  Stay with that feeling, Betty! Stay with it!  Betty!  Simon?  Betty! I can't believe it's really you!  Technically I'm a magical A.I. avatar  derived from Betty's memories.  Close enough!  Shwang!  The system appears to be stabilizing.  Crown shields are coming back online.  What does that mean?  The crown will re-seal itself off from foreign entities.  But I-I can come back and visit Simon, right?  No.  What about me?  Don't freak out, but you're gonna be deleted.  No!  It's okay, Simon.  I'm just glad I didn't destroy your world.  You are my world.  Goodbye, freaks!  Don't forget Gunther!  Bye, dude.  I'm gonna be nicer to penguins from now on.  Okay.  Wait, what?  Whoa.  Before I go, there's something I have to tell you.  Simon: Tell me, Betty.  I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I  Betty!  I'm seeing remnants of Betty's program in the readouts.  It's like her data left a shadow print on the circuitry.  Simon: So, what was that thing you were gonna tell me?  I just said that for drama.  I figured it would drive you crazy,  but at least you'd never stop thinking about me.  Betty, I never could.  Mwah!  I don't see anything.  These are just weird dots to me.  My place is trashed and I can't remember a thing.  Great dinner party?  Best I've ever been to.  What? I don't like relaxing.  I like science.


     Jake, if I beat you, you have to call me "sensei" for a month. Deal. Hi, guys. ALL: 'Sup, Turtle Princess? Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Argh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Get your hands off me, Steven! Yah! You too, Chad! Hey, girl. Hey, girl. Brought you some little fruit pies. Awesome. How you doing out here? Turtle Princess, the men out here will not leave me alone!  It must be nice. Nah, it's horrible. They just want me for my lumps.  These lumps aren't for sale, Billy! '  - Ugh! Aren't you sick of men going after your turtle lumps? Actually, I've never been able to work my T-Lumps. I just know what I read in books.  Hey, you should write a book telling me how to do it. Oh, my glob. Turtle Princess, I always wanted to write trashy books for ladies!  Hyah! Back up off me, Ricky! Yeah, everyone needs to know that when I work these lumps, no man is immune to their influence. Jake's ball landed over here, Beemo!  LSP, Finn would be perfect as the test subject for your lump studies. Yay! I win! Bow to your sensei. Aw!  You got to go undercover and conduct your lump science on him. Prove to the world that even a white knight like Finn is no match for the power of your lumps. I'll do it -- for the world! And for you, girl. Oh, girl!  Mâ Day one -- on my way to Finn and Jake's. Side note -- I look fresh to death with my new dress and purse. Mm. Mm. Mm. Hello?  Hey, Jake. Is Finn home? Ohh! 'Sup, LSP?  Oh, hey. I'm answering that ad you put out for the "Adventure Secretary." What? Ugh! Hold on. I'll get it.  Hold on. It's down in there. Okay, wait. I got it. Here you go. "Wanted -- Adventure Secretary."  Smells like fruit pie. It's nice of you to want to be our secretary, but we don't need one. Dude, look at her. Mmm. Oh, glob. Yeah, it's sad. Come on. We got to help her. Ah. All right, LSP, come inside. Awesome. Totally nailed the interview.  I'm gonna need a secretary desk. Rah!  I'm starving! What's for dinner?! Oh. Uh we got some blueberries. Jake has saltines. Yuck. Looks like I'll have to bust out these cobras to get a better dinner.  Hey, Finn. You got anything better to eat? Oh, cool -- old spaghetti. I'm gonna go heat this up. Chapter one -- "Gotcha." Have a good night. See you in the morning. Good night, you guys! Finn is even more overpowered by my lumps than I thought. I guess at the end of the day, it's all about the lumps. TURTLE PRINCESS RING-TONE: Hey, girl. Hey --  Hey, girl. Oh, Turtle Princess, this book is coming out awesome! Oh, good, girl. I can't wait to read it. Thanks, girl. - Good' night, girl. - Good night, girl.   Huh? What's that? 'Sup, LSP? What are you guys doing? We're carrying these rocks on an adventure up to the mystery mountains. Oh, nuh-uh! I am not gonna carry rocks! That's okay. Jake can carry them. Yep. Ugh! Fine. You're welcome, Finn. Ugh! My arms weren't meant to carry so many rocks, you guys. Come on, LSP. You can make it. Ugggggh!  RING-TONE: Hey, girl. Hey --  Turtle Princess, you can't call me. You're gonna blow my cover! Good morning, girl. Good morning, girl. Would you be mad at me if! ask out Billy, that vulture who was hitting on you? I think he's cute, and Hey, LSP, shake a leg. Can't talk right now, girl.  The Loch of Phantoms. Princess Bubblegum said the rocks would show us the safe path. This is way too boring for my book. Oh! My shoulder strap! Oh, my orange juice is coming out! Ha! Gotch-- huh? Jake. "Kerploop!" JAKE:  "Kerploop." Not gotcha? All right!  Ughhh! This place is plops, Finn! We can meet you back at the tree house later, if you want. That weird light.  Hey, Finn! Finn, my dress is slipping! Huh? Listen, LSP, we gotta be careful. Whooooo! My dress! - No, LSP! It's not safe! - Aaah! Don't look! He-e-e-e-e-y! Oh. Hey, Fi-i-i-nn.  She's stuck in there! We gotta bust through this wall! I knew you couldn't resist me, Finn. Oh, lump. I took it too far. My powerful lumps have turned Finn into a grody monster! Get away, Finn! Aah! No! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Hyah! Aah! I-l can't look!  Aah!  That was so crazy! What just happened?! Oh. Um, Bubblegum sent us on a quest to destroy these cursed mirrors. Evil stuff happens when you look into them. Oh, glob. I had to look, 'cause I looked so good. LSP, you don't need a mirror to know you look good. You're beautiful on the inside. Like your brain and stuff. Thanks for saying that stuff. And for saving me from those mirror-yous. That was pretty nice. Okay, time to write. Gonna make this trashy. Turtle Princess will be all  "Oh, my gosh! Number-one best seller!"  Heh heh. Yeah.  What is he doing out there? Sometimes, after an adventure, he likes to sit out there and think. RING-TONE: Hey, girl. Hey --  - Hello? - Hey, girl. Are you almost done with your book? Oh! I'm working on it. I've been doing so much research. Did Finn fall victim to your lumps? Um yeah. Great! Bring in your manuscript right away. Click! Yeah a book about how I'm hot and Finn only wants -- he's so hot. Old spaghetti. "Kerploop." You're beautiful on the inside. Finn has the hottest lumps, but his lumps are on the inside. Aaaargh! He's great! Uh bye, LSP.  This isn't what you said it'd be about. I know. I -- I love it! Oh, my glob! Finn, you've probably been wondering where I've been for the last few hours. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I have. Finn, I was never really your secretary, Finn. I was writing a book about how you were a slave to my lumps 'cause I'm so hot, Finn! Oh. Okay. But you're the one who's hot, Finn! Wow. Uh thanks! No. Thank you. LSP, you're wearing garbage for clothes! Gotcha. Aah!    


  He's heading for that cupe! Come on, Jake. Oh, yeah. What?! He's gone. What? What happened? Hey, hey! Did you guys see that? You know that was a ghost wearing a dead guy? That might be the nastiest thing I've ever seen. N-n-n-n-nasty, nasty Jazz. Nast Hey, hey! Easy, buddy. That's our friend Billy. He got possessed by the Lich! Oh, sorry! Sorry. I didn't mean nothin' by it. I mean, I have a lot of nasty friends. My uncle was nasty. I'm basically honorary nasty. Do you know where he went? We have to find our friend. Who knows. Uh oh. Actually, it depends on the wish I granted him. Wish? Yeah, he wished for the extinction of all life, and I did it. I guess it changed his timeline or something. What?! Oh, glob!! Whoa, wait a minute. How can that be if I'm still here kickin' it with my main man, Finn? Oh, that's because you're safe in my time room until you make your wish. Oh-h-h-h. I wish that life wasn't anymore exti Whoa! Wait, Jake. Don't mess this up. Think about it. If we wish everything back to normal, the Lich could just jazz it up again. Oh, yeah. Jazz. Hmm. Hmm. Hm-m-m-m. I got it! I wish The Lich never even ever existed. Mom? Mom, what's wrong? Finn, I need you to do something for me. It's very important. I need you to take the mule into town today and sell him for as much as you can. What? Sell Bartram? But I love Bartram. What the heck, mom?! Shh! Finn, please. Just do as I say. - Got it? - Dad? I push you. You fall down. The Destiny Gang? Finn, please. Everything will be fine, I promise. Now, just do as I say. I'm sorry, Bartram. I guess dad must be in real trouble to be doing this. But I bet there's a lot of fine folk lookin' to buy a good mule. Why, I bet I could even come visit sometimes. Won't that be swell, Bartram? Bartram? Dang it, Bartram. Bar-bar? What the Bar-bar, how'd you get up there? Jake, look! A golden crown! Unbelievable! We can sell it and keep Bartram! Bong bong! Hold it right there! Who are you? I'm a thousand years old, and this is my crown. Okay, okay. But, um maybe I could just borrow it for a little while? No! No! No! This crown is magic. Bad, terrible magic. Too dangerous for mortal fingies like yours! One thousand years ago, my beloved friend, Simon Petrikov, gave his life to save this foolish, unworthy planet from annihilation. A frightful bomb was poised to bathe the land in mutogenic horror. But using his mastery of ice and snow, Simon froze the bomb in mid-flight only inches from the ground, where it remains to this very day, today, ever-ripe and ready to blow. But he alone was not saved. Trapped under the giant weight of the enormous bomb, poor Simon perished. Little help? And the horrible crown, grieving its lost master, loosed a spasm of magic so wild and crazy, the entire Earth was buried in ice for 400 boring years. Uh None of that is true, 'cause magic is fake.

-  -  -  -  Aaaaaaaah! Hold on, Sweet Pig Trunks! We're comin'! -  - There, there, Sweet P. It was just a dream. Just a dream. That's my brave little boy. Now you better get dressed. Today's your first day of school!  Now eat up. Yum! That's fuel you're gonna need later to soak up all the education. Yes, dad! Okay. There's your lunch. And an apple for the teacher. Both: Aww  Golly, it's awful nice of y'all to take Sweet P to school on his first day. Finn: Our plezh, T.T. Jake: Yeah, first day of school can be real tough. We wouldn't want Sweet P freakin' out or awakening any latent evil spirits within himself.  Well, we're gonna miss you, son.  Jake: You think still he's secretly evil, that he's still all lichy in there? Finn: Mm, not sure. Jake: I don't know, Finn. He just seems so Sweet. Finn: Mm. - Both: Bye! - Bye! -  - Jake: So far, so good. -  -  Finn: Fat squirrel in trub! Aah! - Oh, no! - Jake: Wait, Finn! Let's just see how this plays out. - Finn: Mm. Finn: All right. Welp, see ya later, Sweet P. - Jake: Bye! - Bye, Teddy-man. Hey, baby man! Did your grandma knit your clothes? Yeah! And she's my mom! -  -  Why you laughin', baby man? - You're not even a real kid! - Huh? You're nothin' but a big, weird baby man! Baby man!  Let's see what we got here. Hello, there! Intimidated by those bullies, eh? Uh Yeah. What's your name, kid? Sweet P. I'm the one true king of OOO. This is my attorney, Toronto. Sweet P, there are all kinds of education, you know. No. Yes, sir, all kinds, such as dancing. You could blow off this podunk school and get a proper dance education. Then you could come back and really show those mean kids and make your parents proud! - Hey, king of OOO! - Yes, Toronto?  You are a certified dance instructor, right? Show the kid the dance you do. No, that dance is too tough for an amateur. Aw, come on. You got to show the kid. It's awesome! Yeah, I know it's awesome, but I really don't think - the kid is ready. - Ready? I don't think he's tough enough to be ready. I'm tough enough to be ready! See? The kid is tough And ready. Please! Ah! I do see it! Eeeee! You've got a good eye, and you are a good dog. Watch this, kid. Ah! Both: Mm-hmm. Why, we got us a prodigy here. You're ready for advanced classes. Hey, you mugs! Want to see some world-class dancing? Just turn around! - Ah, leave me alone! - Leave me alone, too! I'm turning around. Teeth! Ha! You did great! You should come back tomorrow, kid for more dancin' lessons! Have a gold star. Show that to your parents, kid. They'll love it! But don't tell 'em where you got it, or you'll ruin the surprise. Just think of how proud they'll be at your big, uh end-of-the-year recital! You understand? Of course Sweet P understands! He's a good boy. A good boy! So, how was school? Yes, how'd you do? A gold star! I'm gonna put this where we can see it every day. - Thumbs up. - Thumbs up. - Both: Come on! Thumbs up! - Thumbs up.  - Thumbs up. - Thumbs up. Well, this is our place. We'd invite you in, but - The place is a mess. - He's right. We're filthy. Listen, we all need a break. Go on home, kid, and we'll see you tomorrow. Mm. Sweet P, we're going on a date. You're smart and educated enough to stay at home all by yourself. The proof is on the fridge.  Mama and papa will be so surprised if the refrigerator is all covered with stars when they get back. One more star should do it. I need to find king of OOO and Toronto to get me that last star. I don't know, K.O. They've gone rancid. Horse feathers. A lick of gold paint is all it needs. Just a couple more garbage stars, eh, Toronto? Mo' stars means mo' dosh. Soon we'll have enough scratch to fund my big comeback. This kid is great at helping us rob people! And best of all, he doesn't know a thing. Because if he did - Both: We'd have to take care of him! -  -  -  What was that? Sweet P? - What did you hear? - What does it matter? - None of it was good. - We got to take care of him. Aaaaah! I shouldn't have said that out loud.  Mom! Dad! Hey, kid! Toronto and I talked it over, and we decided we're not going to "take care" of you. We're gonna burn down your orchard. - Noooooo! - Yep. We're gonna burn it down. Unless Unless? You leave home and your loving parents and come dance with us forever. - Forever. - Nooo! No, no, no, no, no! Come on, Sweet P! The people love you! They do? Well, mostly they love to laugh at you. I mean look at yourself. You're a a a big weird baby man!  - Baby man, baby man - Both: Baby man, baby man, baby man, baby man! - Both: Stop. -  Both: I have learned much from you. Thank you, my teachers. And now for your education. Before there was time Before there was anything There was nothing. And before there was nothing - There were monsters. -  -  - Here's your gold star. -  - Mr. King of OOO? Uh-ba-ba-ba-ba. Huh?  Monster! Aaaaaaah! Just a dream. - Mornin', son. - Good morning, Sweet P.  Surprise! Oh! My, my, where did you get all this bling? Uh My teachers. Wow! How nice of those teachers. Mm-hmm! Hey, baby man. Guess who we are.  Huh? -  -

I was trying to surprise you by moving you to my place while you sleep, then have you wake up to breakfast in bed. But now you ruined the surprise. Way to go. Do you think I'd like being kidnapped? Is that what you think I want? Okay! Here we go. You're the victim, right? You know what? Since day one, I've been doing everything to make this relationship work, and for what? Banana guards! Babe, come on. We promised we wouldn't make our problems public. Take him out. Baby, no! What are you doing?! Baby bear! Gah! This is just so crazy! If you can honestly look into your heart and tell me you want me to leave, I'll go. Okay, leave. Wow. Did did you look in your heart? Like, all around it? Yes. I see. Then, obviously, you have got some heavy emotions stirring in you, and you have said some very rash things. Guards, take me away! Ice King! Get out of Princess I'm leaving! Ugh. I don't know. Did I say the right thing? I can never tell with that girl.  All I can think about is you, baby girl. I got to leave Ooo, start somewhere fresh. Goodbye, Gunther. You're the man of the house now.

You seen my boom box? I totally puked in Jimmy's stereo and killed the party I was at. He was like "Hey, Party God! You can't spin faster than me!" And I was like, "I totally can, Jimmy!" So we started spinning. Then I got super-dizzy and was like  right into the speaker. Ha ha! Found it. Okay, I'm bouncing out, babe. Oh. You want to hang before you go? Oh. Yeah Well, I'm sort of in the middle of a party, so Oh. Well, it would just be for a minute. But uh, I puked in Jimmy's stereo. I can't party foul the party. I'm the Party God. Okay.

That's us. Well, I like you. You're welcome to stay here as long as you want. Are you sure? Yes. I appreciate your company.  Have you ever had a friend Â¿ Como este?  Oh!

Vivir en Armonia The Ice King and the SeÃ±orita Isla El rey hielo y la SeÃ±orita Isla  Yeah, well, P. B. Is just so closed off to her emotions. She crushes the relationship so she doesn't ever have to develop feelings. I don't even matter to Party God. He just parties all the time. He doesn't even notice if I'm there or not. Oh, that's terrible. At least Bubblegum cares if I'm there. Sometimes I just wish he'd go off into outer space so I'd never have to see him again. Yeah, he's awful. You shouldn't have to put up with that. Yeah. That's true. Yeah, girl. I'm gonna break up with him. Yeah, girl!  Oh, snaps! Good luck!  I forgot the batteries. Hey, babe? I have to tell you something. Uh babe? Found 'em! Huh? Hey, what's that? Oh, that just washed up on me after a storm. Hmm. Oh, whatever. What'd you want to tell me?

     JAKE: If I hear another peep, there's gonna be trouble. Final warning! Okay. Go ahead, bmo.  Okay, welcome back to the program. We're talking with my special guest, finn the human. FINN: Hello. JAKE: Now, finn, before the break, you were saying something interesting -- that you're getting out of the romance biz. So, what happened? FINN: Well, I don't want to bore your listeners  but let's just say the time has come to stop dating princesses and return to saving 'em.  JAKE: And you're not just saying that to, uh, make yourself seem more attractive? FINN: Yeah, of course. No games goin' on here.  JAKE: Hold on, hold on. What's that noise? I think that someone's knocking at the door. JAKE: Can you see who it is? Yes, Jake. JAKE: So it's going pretty good, huh? FINN: Yeah, but maybe we should stop talking about this love junk and get back to adventuring. Finn! Jake! I need your help! It's an emergency! FINN: Now we're talking! Don't cry, slime princess. We're at your service. I need finn to marry me.  FINN: I'm sorry, s.P., but I've given up the dating scene. You don't understand. If I don't get a husband, I'll lose my kingdom. ICE KING: I'll do it! JAKE: What did I tell you?!  Please let me explain. Recently, my much hotter, younger sister, blargatha, married a slime rogue named guillermo. As a result, elder plops decreed that if I was not married by tomorrow, rule of the slime kingdom would pass to my sister, which I'd be, like, totally fine with, except I recently discovered they are both evil. Evil to the core! They plan to militarize the kingdom and begin a campaign of aggressive conquest, sacking our neighboring kingdoms, stealing their resources, and eventually taking over the entire world! JAKE: Ew. Finn, this will happen unless someone marries me. FINN: No. ICE KING: Psst! JAKE:  Please, finn. I know I've crushed on you in the past, but I have no intention of locking this down. Our marriage will only be in name only. FINN: Mm JAKE: Wait! I'm coming, too! I'm gonna eat popcorn and make hilarious jokes. Aw. Who ate all my popcorn? ICE KING:  Call this a room? There's not even a window. Oh, wait. Are we rolling? JAKE:  How much farther? This popcorn's not gonna last all day. All right, now it might. We're here. Welcome to my little oasis in the wasteland. JAKE: Oasis? More like, "no way, sis!"  FINN: Huh? JAKE:  FINN: Whoa! This is amazing! You okay, buddy? JAKE: You could say I got out of there in the "lick" of time. Zing! Quickly. We're already late.  This is the most important place in the kingdom. FINN: The royal palace? No, it's where me and all my main splirts hang out. Hi, girls! ALL: H-I-I-I-I-I!  FINN: Tree trunks and Mr. pig, what are you doing here? Oh, we always come here when we want to shake it, finn. It's the only triple-cray-rated disco in all of ooo. Get your face pretty, finn. My people are already assembled in the courtyard.  Greetings, loyal slimejects!  I would like to introduce my new husband -- finn the human!  What did I tell you? Piece of cake. Attention, my loyal slimejects.  It's blargatha. And that's the mysterious guillermo. He hails from a faraway, much more somber slime kingdom where people have strange customs and no love in their eyes. Their discos aren't even rated one cray. My husband would like to say something. And, uh, he would, too, if not for his extremely sore throat, so I will say it for him. We challenge you to the trials of glarb.  I object! Ancient traditions such as the trials of glarb are no longer relevant in our modern self-indulgent society. Order! Order! I demand order! I, elder plops, being the coolest guy in the room, will settle this dispute. The matter will be settled on the battleground FINN: All right! the battleground of love. FINN: Aw! The couple that I deem most truly in love shall rule the slime kingdom for life.  Plops out.  FINN:  JAKE: This is, like, the opposite of what you wanted. Welcome, everyone, to the trials of glarb, hosted by me, elder plops. The first trial will be crooning. You guys are gonna get into these sweet boats I made and croon for each other on the lake. The most loving and heartfelt song, judged by me, elder plops, will win. I really want to hear some emotional song work here. The people want to hear emotional stuff. So let's see some stuff, all right? Okay, finn, you can do it. FINN: I don't know. I'm still jacked up over my lady biz. Well, just lose yourself in your own mind and go numb. Then let it all out. FINN: Okay. Just let it all out.  When I'm heating up my lunch or delivering a dungeon punch I can't get over you your kiss is burned into my brain Simon's hair is clogging up my drain I just can't get over you see your face all over ooo sticks to me like a coat of glue I can't get over you  Why can't I get over you? Finn, way to go. I could tell the people were really impressed. Guillermo, you're up. Hmm? Okay, guillermo. I'll ask, I'll ask Guillermo still has a sore throat! May I sing on, uh, his behalf? Elder plops thinks that's okay.  I want to touch your hand with my hand I want to rub your cheek with my cheek maybe later we can get "do not disturb"  I'm done! As elder plops, I have heard many songs in my life, and I can only say this Finn, you win this one. FINN: Whoo! Yes!  Welcome, everyone, to our second trial Spooning. When I say go, the big spoon will put his arm around the little spoon and cuddle. I will be watching you spoon, measuring and assessing your love by posture and overall vibe. The best cuddle, or spoon, wins. FINN: Wait. What? JAKE:  Spooners, get in your futons. FINN: Uh, I don't feel good about this. Ready, set Spoon! FINN:  No, wait. I don't want to do this! Wrap those gorgeous pythons around me! FINN: No! This feels weird! Come on, finn, they're crushing us! Wuh! Wuh! Wuh! Blargatha and guillermo, very nice. FINN: Nooooooooooooooooo! Yeesh. All right, everyone, stop. I've seen enough. Blargatha and guillermo's love was way-off-the-charts good. They win. Yes! I love you, baby. You spoon so good! FINN:  No! The score is tied. There's one more trial after spooning and crooning -- smooching. I'm sorry it doesn't rhyme with crooning and spooning. We will begin our next trial on the morrow!  This is not going well. FINN: I'm sorry, slime princess. I'm just going to mess this next trial up. Is it because you haven't done much kissing? You don't have to be embarrassed by your innocence. FINN: Pretending to be in love is making me sad. It makes me think about flame princess. What if I pretend to be your ex? FINN: That's worse, I think. Well, it looks like I'm losing my kingdom to the forces of evil. FINN:  No, slime princess. Let's practice this smooch. Mmmmm. FINN: I'm sorry. I -- I can't!  Bunk this! Wait! Where are you going? FINN: I'm going to punch guillermo in his stupid face till he agrees to leave the kingdom. I want to come! FINN:  Hey, guillermo! Can you come out here for a Quick meeting? JAKE: More like a quick beating. Hey-o! He says eat a fat dollop and buzz off! Blargatha! FINN: Hyup! Hmm.  Finn, you shouldn't break in to a woman's room. FINN: Hyah! Everyone okay? JAKE: Yes. "Tank" you. FINN: Hyah! Eh? FINN: Guillermo! Hyah!  Are you dead, man? Aw, geez, bro. Huh? These are olives. Uh-oh. Blargatha, why would you make a fake husband? You're so hot! You don't know how hard it is to be this hot. Women don't want to talk to you because they're intimidated, and guys don't want to talk to you because they're too scared. You're alone in the hottest, most sexiest prison. So I stuck some olives on a glop of gelatin and called him my lover. FINN: Well, I'm sorry, blargatha, but you're going to have to spend more time in your metaphorical prison in a real prison, 'cause what you're doing is illegal. Uh, no, it just disqualifies her from challenging me. FINN: Whoops.  By the authority of elder plops, I officially declare You are still the slime princess. ALL: Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Finn, what do you think? FINN: I don't want to disappoint all these people.  I'm sorry! I can't do it!    FINN: What Is the meaning of soup? JAKE: What? I don't know. What's with all the weird quest-- FINN: What is the meaning of spoon? JAKE: Shoot, man. Are you still lady-sad about flame princess? You know, it's okay if you are. FINN: Nah. That's all fine. I've just been feeling kind of gray, is all. Like, my inside voice has been kind of quiet lately, not a lot of instructions forthcoming, you know? JAKE: Yeah, well, sounds like you're sad. Listen, finn. Girls is like horses -- when you fall down, it's important that you get right back on again On a different horse. And there's a lot of fish in the sea, a lot of fish. A penny saved is a penny earned. FINN: YeahI-I guess. Or maybe dating girls is like riding a bicycle JAKE: Yeah, man, yeah! FINN: Where, like, if you mess up, you can get really hurt forever or hurt someone you really care about. JAKE: Uh, well, I suppose. Anyway, I hope this mystery cave we're looking for is as weird as flambo's brother says it is. Maybe that'll snap you out of the -- whoa! What?! What's this train all about? No one said nothing about no train in the way. FINN: Relax, buddy. We'll just cross after it passes. No big thing, really. JAKE: Oh, yeah. It's two hours later now. What the stonk? Oh. Okay. Hey, the train just goes in a big circle. We can cut right through the middle. Blingle, blongle, bloongle. Come on. Hey, you know, I just had another idea. If we just stay put here on the train, we can ride it all the way to the cave. Blingle, blongle, bloongle! Hyah! Give me -- give me the loot! FINN: Ow! Yow! Come on, give it! Give me that hat! FINN: Knock it off. Aah! Whoa, dang! FINN:  JAKE: Hey, finn! FINN: Whoa. JAKE: Look at all the loot that guy dropped while you whipped his butt. FINN: Dang. Look at that sword. Whoa. It feels kind of right. Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh, whoosh. Whoosh!  Whoa. JAKE:  It's pretty fun, huh? FINN: Yeah, man! It's spicy baby fun! JAKE: You want to go see what other kind of monsters are on this train? FINN: Yes! JAKE:  FINN: Whoa. Crystal ants, I think. JAKE:  Cool.  FINN:  Yeah!  Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!  Ha! JAKE:  Welcome back, buddy. FINN: Man, look at all this rad loot. JAKE: Yeah, this is a pretty neat train. We should come back again someday. FINN: Wow, what do you mean? We just started only like three hours ago. JAKE:  YeahI-I'm just getting a little bored, is all. All these cars and monsters are kind of all the same. It's a little boring. FINN: Oh, come on. It's fun. Just one more car. Come on. Come on, man. Come on! JAKE: All right. Just one more. FINN:  Yes! JAKE:  FINN: Hmm? Where is everybody? JAKE: Hey, hey! Empty car. I think we beat it, buddy.  FINN: Whoa, man. Boss battle! Let's chew it up! JAKE: Okay, but this is the last one, okay? FINN: We'll see!  JAKE: Hey, man. Remember we were going to that weird cave? I bet it's not too late to check it out. FINN: Eh, weird cave, weird train. I'm cool here. JAKE:  Okay. FINN: Hyah! Aah! Give me a break! FINN: Oh? Oh, dang. Boss loot! Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm. Oh, yes. JAKE: No, thank you. FINN: Jake, hurry! Next car! Slime crimes! JAKE: You have fun. I'm just gonna watch. FINN: Yeah! Huh! Ugh! Hey! Ow!  Ow. Cool. Acid.  Hey, also, man, aren't you, like, getting kind of hungry? FINN: Yeah, man. I guess we've been here for a while. JAKE: More than a while, dude. I've already missed my bathroom window. FINN: Yeah, I guess I could take a snack break. JAKE: Okay. Well, we'll go back to the tree house, and I'll make us some lunch. I could make the toaster pancakes you like. Or maybe I can boil up some hot dogs. Or -- FINN:  Look, now we don't got to do that thing you wanted to do. JAKE: Aah! FINN: Hot meat! JAKE: Ants again?! FINN: Ant no thang! Hyah! Caught with your ants down! Ants for nothing! Forget about ants. What's wrong? Feeling antsy?! JAKE:  Dude, this is the ant car. We already did the ant car. You did all the ants. FINN: Same car -- ugh -- but those were blue ants. These are red ants. JAKE: Finn, I think we should take off. I think this place is bad news for you. FINN: Man, no way. All this feels good, like my inside voice is saying, "hey, keep it up. This is good stuff." Aah! Hey! Hyah! Like when you made those biscuits way back and I kept eating them until they were all gone, like that. JAKE: Finn! I made those biscuits with so much butter. You were just responding to the butter! This whole place is butter! FINN: Yeah! Boss fight! Yeah!  Hyah!  My junk and stuff! FINN: Check it out. Battle moon. JAKE: What?  Finn, this is a future crystal! Look! That's you, dude. You're old, you're alone, and you're still fighting on this dumb train. OLD FINN: Get ant of town. FINN: Whoa. I'm gonna have the best life. Oh! Hair apes! JAKE: Nah, dude. I'm bored, I'm tired, and I'm going backTo the tree house. You can come with me if you want. FINN: What? No, man. It's better on the train. Stuff makes sense here.  FINN: Ow!  JAKE: I'm sorry. If you wish to join me, I'll be in the tree house, experiencing the joys of life and not getting attacked by gorillas made out of hair. FINN: You'll be back. JAKE: No, I won't, finn. Goodbye! FINN: Huh.  FINN: Hey!  Hair we go! JAKE: Hey, what are you doing up here? Whoop. JAKE: Are you getting sick of things down there, too? Whoo. JAKE: Mm-hmm. You're not gonna try and zap me, are you? I wonder what my kids are doing.  Hey. I knew it. Got to find that kid. Hey, finn! F-- whoa. UmHey, there, friend. I ain't looking for no trouble. I'm just looking for my friend finn. Maybe you've seen him? About five feet tall, picks his nose, and always kind of smells funny l-- FINN: Hey. Hey. Jake, it's me. I'm just all souped up now. JAKE: Ah, geez, finn. I -- for a minute there, I thought you were one of those twisted, lost-soul, boss guys. FINN: LA, LA, LA. JAKE: Wait. You are! You are one! FINN: What? Those guys are cool. JAKE: That's it, man. I'm getting you off this train whether you like it or not. FINN: Jake, stay back. I mean it. JAKE: Oh, please. What are you gonna do? I'm 10 times stronger th-- hey!  FINN:  JAKE: Oh, gross.  FINN: Yoink! Jake, trying to tell me what to do. Yeah, right. I tells me what to do. Now, let's see what we got here. Apple, apple, chicken, apple. Oh, yeah. That little orb in which I rule. Let's see that again, orb. Yeah. That's right. Looking right.  Wait a second. Who's that sad, bored little guy following me around? Jake? All those years, he stayed with me. OLD JAKE: Finn, can we slow down? My feet hurt. OLD FINN: What? FINN: Oh, Jake. Hang in there, buddy. I'm gonna set this right. JAKE: Finn! Finn, I'm sorry. I'll stay on the train with you. I swear. Just get this stuff off of me. FINN: No, I'm sorry, Jake. I messed up. But don't worry. It's all over now. JAKE: You mean, we're getting off the train? FINN: WellYou are. I'm gonna keep playing for a while. I'll meet you back home in a week or two. JAKE: Oh, man. Don't you see that's just the train talking? It's got its hooks in you. FINN: No. No, for real. My inside voice is telling me it's time. Here. See for yourself. JAKE: Yeah, man. That's what I'm talking about. That is what I'm talking about.  


  Shelby? Shelby, wake up. Where am I? Tree Trunks, what's going on? You've been snoozing on my dome. I just woke up in this room with these fellas. Nectar, Ice Cream, and one of the Lemoncarbs. Awake! Avast! Hold tight your buns, if buns you do hold dear, for time has come to wake and run and not give way to fear! What are those awful words?! I am reading the wall. They are wall words. "Beyond this room are a thousand rooms. Outside of them, still more." "Behind each door on every floor Danger! Danger! Evermore." "Stranger, hark! The traps galore may kill you whilst you do explore to free yourself" Huh? Oh! Now, where were we "To free yourself from this tomb and nevermore re-enter, find the room amidst the rooms that lies exactly center?" It's a map! I no longer need this map. I have infallible recall. Oh! Th-Th-The room is trying to hug us! Oh no! Oh, dag! Check out my mods, bro! Aaaaah! Huh? Enough of this! Ohh! Huh? This room doesn't have any doors. We're we're trapped! This is wrong. The map lied to me! It doesn't want me to find the exit! Ice King, how do you taste?! Uh, nice, I guess. Mild or spicy!? Oh, uh Kind of lonely. Make yourself into food now! You're gonna eat me? Oh, yeah, right! Shlop your mouths up. I have found an oven and baking supplies! I can make an apple pie for all of us! Make them fast, "serval!" If you want a taste of my juicy apple pie, you better be nice. You got that? I am sorry. Make pies, slave. Okay, that's better. Now, let's see about this pie business. All right, gentlemen, have a look at my luscious, gooey apple pie. Ooh! Aah! No! Mmm. Acceptable. Uh, Lemongrab. - What? - Never mind. Come on, guys, that mouse showed us the room door. Say, you know what's weird? What, papi? Uh, well, isn't it weird how Tree Trunks' ability to make pies is specifically what helped us escape from that room? I make pies, too, papi. Right, yeah, like battery pies or something? No, real pies. Don't you remember? I am your su Hey look! Another room! Good grief, it's humid in here. That door will lead us closer to the exit! Hold up! Hold up! Look! There has to be a way to get across without that thing chompin' our hoo-hoos! Can't you fly us across, papi? Uh, yeah, I can sure try Galdang, this heat is negating my powers! Can't do nothing with this steam comin' off the water! Aah! Dear glob! Zap! Ach! Look at this! Pbht! Well, that's it. Show's over! I'll just die here, and y'all can eat my body if you want to survive. Golly! How're we ever gonna worm our way out of this fishy situation? I think I have an idea. That's a girl, Tree Trunks. You can do it! Ah, this is all gonna work out just fine. Ooh! That's warm on my undercarriage. Help me, guys! Yes, papi! Lemongrab, come on! Bleh! Wow! That was heavy, man! Haha! Yeah, I've been reborn! Look! Let's go then! Ohh! Papi, no! Ouchies! Aah! Look out, Shelby! Whoa! Whoa! Aah! Wah! My juice! My vital juices! Mommy!! The hidden door! My vital essence depleted. Must replenish Oh, step back, y'all. Ugh. Ew. Oh, that will do, Slave Trunks. To the spiraling ledge! We almost there, Lemongrab? Yes! Faster T.T.! Don't criticize my running, Shelby. Aaah! This door leads to the center exit. The door is secured with an esoteric encryption system. Well, that's okay 'cause you can "hack the main frame" or whatever, right, BMO? I'm not BMO. I'm your son NEPTR. I-I throw pies. Ahs! I grabbed the wrong robot! Dirt! Nuts! Face! Uh, what is going on here, Ice King? Yes. I am getting a weird feeling in my stomach, and I think it's 'cause of you, Mr. Wizard. You better fess up to whatever you're doing. I got no time for nobody dancin' around and actin' a fool at my expense. I'm Tree Trunks, and people know I'm kind and honest. That's why people like me. Huh? What? What was she saying? So stop sellin' fib bibs and give it straight. Oh! All right! I knocked y'all out and brought you here! I'm sorry, but I had to do it! Each of you possessed the exact qualities to pass the various tests of this dungeon. Tree Trunks with your baking skills Lemongrab with your lemony, juicy - Essence. - Yeah. Shelby, who should have been the bait for the fish. Yeah, but no thanks. And BMO, who should have been here instead of this weird piece of junk that I don't remember nothin' about. Aah! I failed! Father, look at me! Are you happy with me now, papi? Yes! Yes! Oh, my son! The grand prize of me loins! Now you see why I needed to bring you here! Behold the ancient sleeping magi of life giving. What's it do? Whatever goes in the magi's flames comes to life! Anything at all! Like an ashtray? Yes! Isn't it amazing? Uh, you should have told us. I would have freaking brought something. Well, don't be sad, because I brought the ultimate thing this! Your journal? Except it's not my journal! It's my "Fionna and Cake" fan fiction! All my brilliant fantasies will now be real! Fionna, Cake, Marshall Lee They'll all be living, breathing beings just like me! You serve no function. You must be destroyed! No! Aaaaaah! Yes! Yes! Whoo! Ha-ha-ha! Yeah! Nooo! No! Another cruel joke on my life! Oh, good, you're awake, you bum! Look what you did! Get out of my face! Yeah, yeah, get lost! This is the spot? Right here? What was that? Come on, Ice Cream, we're leaving. Okay. I'm tellin you, dude, my pie-dar is goin nay-nays. Ho! - What the? - Write in me! This is very strange! T.T., where's the pie at? Uh, Mr. Lemoncarb ate it. Bye-don't-follow-me. Hey, Jake, can I hitch a ride back home? Yeah, but what the heck is going on here? Ice King was doing some desperate business. It didn't work out. I think he's pretty bummed out about it. Don't be sad, papi. Your characters can always be real in the garden of your mind. They can? Remember when you showed me your imagination zone? Yes, yes, if I can concentrate It worked! I missed you, Ice King! Oh, Fionna, can dreams be as real as waking life? Of course they can! Dreams are real! Then I will wait for you from across the threshold of consciousness! Our worlds will surely meet, Ice King! I, too, feel this. And it feels so strong. It must be true! And across the gulf Who in this world is sadder than the Ice King? Me watching this. you will hear me, and I will hear you.  


   Come on, Marci. It'll only hurt for a second. That's nothing in the face of eternity. A second hurts really bad in the face of eternity. But only for a moment.  Wait. I have an even better idea. Sunscreen SPF 10 Million. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm! I have exactly enough to reach my umbrella. Ha! You really like chopping wood, huh? I'm not chopping wood. I made a toothpick from the ancient elm. See? Uh, knock, knock. What the dip, Marceline? Sorry. It was supposed to be a joke. Actually, I have something really serious to ask. I want you to do the procedure, the one we talked about. I'm sorry, but I don't think you'd make a good blonde. No, not that. I don't want to be a vampire anymore.  Oh, my globness. You said you were working on a cure, right?  Well, the machine is built and the serums are ready, but are you sure you want to do this? I'm sure. Some bad things happened to me when I was little. When I became a vampire, I was just a messed-up kid. Now it's 1,000 years later, and I'm still messed up. I don't want to spend eternity like this, with this emptiness. I want to grow up. Okay. Let's do this. Bubblegum: This means someday you'll die. You know that, right?  I guess that will be my last adventure. Marceline I'm so very, very, very excited to test my new lab out on you. Well, don't get all sentimental on me. Come on over here. You know I care about you. I think you're making the right choice. Your natural life spend is going to be richier and fuller than you can imagine. And someday, when you die, I'll be the one who puts you in the ground. But, you know, this operation might not even work. Whooooooooa! This tickles really bad!  Did it work? Well, I sucked all your vampire effluvium into this bucked. Possibly we won't know the results for a couple of days. In the meantime, you need to get plenty of rest. I'll check your vitals in the morning. Thanks, P. Brains.  No! Huh? It's breakfast time for my sweet babies.  Sweet babies! Operator! Put me through to Finn and Jake. It's an emergency. Victim's lost a lot of blood. Clean entry wounds. It's an expert job. Poor miss baby. She used to be my best cream cow. But now her milk is nonfat. And nanette, my beautiful calf is decaf! That's terrible! Every farm in our village was attacked. Not a goat or a cow or a duck left un-sucked. Well, I've heard enough. Come on, Finn. Let's go arrest Marceline.  Wait a minute. We don't even know if Marceline did this. That's right. I forgot about Ooo's extensive vampire community.  Come on! Yeah, but we need to conduct a proper investigation. I know that. Ain't no rookie. All right, come on. I'll let you be bad cop. I'm already bad cop. Okay, let's not pay seeds. Me and my partner will "interrogate" the suspect police-style. Meanwhile, you sharpen up your pitchforks mob-style. Yeah! Hey, man, that's not right. Marceline's our friend. Physical contact! Officer resisting arrest! - Boom! - Ow!  Ohh, woof. Marceline want to go ny-ny. Don't go ny-ny, Marci. I'm worried. For real? Why? Well, the process was experimental. Like, are there side effects? What happened in your sleep last night? Nobody on record has ever cured vampirism, unless you count killing vampires as curing. In that case, you've cured tons, right? "Tons" is an understatement. That Shnoz was nasty, nasty times.  Hey, cover up. The sun's hitting the door. I'm still undead? We don't know yet. So just chill. Oh, hey, guys. How you doing? Jake did excessive force on me. I'm sorry.  - Let me kiss it!  -  Ew! Ew! Hurry up. Get in here. You done it this time, Marceline. You sucked the life out of defenseless animals! I ain't done nothing. You think I'm buying that boom-boom mountain? Oh, get some proof. You want proof? Look. -  - Whoa! Proof of how off I'm gonna go if you don't confess. Yo, chill, Jake. I'm wilin' out! Listen, Marci, I can barely control this guy, and the villagers are getting crazy. They want to run you over with a wagon, and I'm offering you a way out. Hey, dillweeds, I just swept the place. Sorry. Finn, be real for a second. All right. Look into my eyes, man. I didn't do it. To be honest, it looks like you're not sure if you did it. Okay, I'm not sure! Something weird happened last night. I had a weird dream about stuff. Dream stuff always means something. We'll figure this out, Marci, together. - We promise. - Thanks, Finn. That's cool, you guys, but clean this mess, also, you bums. He's a gob-gleebin' vampire hugger! We got to tell the town! Book it, Terry! Run, Terry! Run! How long do we have to stay in the laundry house, cloud dance? Until Finn and Jake avert the threat. We can't afford to lose more livestock. We're struggling as is to keep our kids fed. Let's just stay in here until the dirty vampire gets what's coming to her. But I want to bop her in the nose! Hey, now, it's too dangerous, okay? A small town, we gotta stay close. Each of us play a vital role, and I can't afford losing any of you. Not you, Clubhouse Sandy, or you, Seed Man, or even you, Sandwich Paul. Sensei Paul. Let's leave the fighting to the fighters, okay, Paul? That hurts. You don't know I teach aikido. Finn's been turned! Wha?! He does the vampire's bidding. Well, there it is. Tonight we burn the beast Marceline.  Woof. I can barely stand up. Look at this. It's my new dance. It's called "I got arthritis." Ohh. The end. You should have hung back with P.B. But I've got a bad feeling like you guys are gonna die without me. Dang, Marci. Have some faith. Geez. Guys, look. Moo! Get it!  You see it? No. But what's that? Must be its filthy lair. -  - What's wrong? Remember how I said my fear of vampires - was based on ignorance? - Yeah. Well, I think that revelation was actually based on true ignorance. So you're scared of vampires again? Yeah, man, don't be ignorant. Come on. Okay, but I'm gonna hold on to your shirt. Look at these poor babies. What's happening to them? Y-y-you tell me, m-man. Moo. I think they're in the process of being turned, eh? Ugh, glob. Something big just dropped in my gut. Hang in there, bro. I can't be here, man. It's too real. Wait, you hear that? Listen.  There!  A little help.  Jake!  Hey, get back here!  Dang! Lost him! Marci? Hey, Marci, you still out here? She's still out here, all right. Oh, hey, man. Did you see a scary beast go by? I chased it out here, but it got away. Oh, we found that beast, and we took care of her real nice You vampire hugger! Wait, what? Lookum yonder. What the blood? You dumb bumbags!  Now look at the other yonder. Huh? Oh, fudge! You're sick, man! What's wrong with you? What? I'm the good guy here. You're gonna explode my friend. All: Blow her up! Blow her up! Oh, flip, you're right. This is way messed up. Run, Finn! You got to beat the sun!  Go, Finn! Go! Aaaaaaah! Marceline, nooooo! Don't let anyone read my diaries. Burn them, Finn! They're embarrassi 


     SQUlD: You guys sure you want another round of squid ink?  BOTH: Ahh! - Ha ha!  You're not too bad for a human boy. Not too bad? l'm better than that. Huh?  Rrrr-yah! Jake, do you hear that? What'd you say? Wha! Whoa! l think someone's crying. - Rah! Ha ha! - Stop! This is serious! l gotta go find out where that crying is coming from. Get back here, you chicken!  What did you call me? You can't just walk away from a roughhouse! Hey! Listen up, you cold-hearted marauders. Somebody's out there crying for help, and l'm not gonna ignore that. Oh, here it comes. Lay it down, Finn! A long time ago, when l was a baby, l went boom-boom on a leaf. Boom! Boom! Then l fell backwards and sat ln my own boom-boom. l crled for a day  but no one came to help me. That day, l vowed to help anyone ln need, no matter how small thelr problem. And that's why l need to go. - Whoo! - Yeah! That's what l'm talking about. - Yeah! - Way to go, Finn. He still cries when he poops. Thanks for being cool, guys. Wait up, Finn!  lt's coming from up there. Someone must be caught in that avalanche. Let's get it on.  So who's crying? l am. Whoa! Aww. What's wrong, fella? You crying boulders? Yes. l am sad, having been forced to watch roughhousing men for centuries. Oh! l see. You're feeling left out, and you want to roughhouse, too! Well, l'll take you on, tough guy. Come on, back me up, Jake. Yeah, do it, Finn! Hit him with a boulder. And then hit him with another rock. Please! No roughhousing. lt m-makes me so sad! What? Why? Because they're so rough on each other. But a smooth, well-controlled roughhouse bolsters your guts and, uh rejuvenates the muscle. No! lt's raunchy and maddening. All those men and their disgusting fantastic bodies. Whoa. This guy's got problems. Look, Mommy. Honey, don't look. That kid's got problems.  l'll help you, Mountain. - Whoa! What?! l'll stop those roughhousers from being rough. Really? You'd do that for me? Yes, sir. My name's Finn and l'm gonna help you out. But, Finn, we're not gonna shut down the roughhouse for real, are we? No way, but there's got to be some kind of solution. l'll figure this out, Mountain Man, yep.  Hey, you guys. - Ah, Finn. Ready to get destroyed?! N-No.  Uh, wait. Um actually, can you guys s-stop being so rough? ALL: What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about, Finn? Could you just tone down the roughhousing a-a little? - What? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, it's all right, fellas. Finn, l'm sure this ''tone down the roughhousing'' thing has something to do with your boom-boom, and l can respect that. But how can we possibly make roughhousing less rough?! l think l have a perfect idea. This will soften your punches for smooth knockouts, like punching a dream. Quack! Quack!  Ha ha! Meow! Meow! Ha ha! Pigs on my knees! Pigs on my knees!  - That's like math. Yeah. - Mathematical.  What do you think? Fixed all your problems, right? No! That was terrible. Now the men are just punching animals. lt's worse than before, and it's in no way a good solution. - l'm sorry. - Well, you should be. lt's not fair to those animals and it's not fair to me. l might just start to cry again, you know?  - Oh, man. - Come on, Jake. l gotta give this another shot. Finn, this guy seems like a real nutjob. You know what l mean? You don't want to get sucked into this guy's hang-ups. Yes, l do, Jake. That's what l vowed -- to help anyone in need, no matter how small their problem.  At least l have to try, brother. JAKE: So be it, brother.  Hey, guys, l'm back.  Hey, guys. Guys? Men, men, please stop for a second. Aah! Men! Boys? Please? l-l have more to ask of you.  Bros? My bros? Brother? What? Did you just pet me? l'll pet you. Pet, pet. Hey! Pet, pet. Hey, this is great! Hey, did you just pet me? - Yeah! l did! - Well, l'm petting you back. W-Whoa. W-What the this is awesome!  All right! This could be it.   Finn -- ha ha ha! -- you're really mixing things up in the best of ways today. Maybe you can solve everyone's problems, like a cherub with his bottom out.  Okay, cool. Hey, l'm gonna go tell the mountain. All right. l'm gonna Mm! Ahh! Mm! l'm gonna stay here this time.  So everything's fine this time, right? Yes! Thank you, Finn. So the mountain is totally fine with everybody petting. l feel great. - Right on, man. The marauders are going crazy over the petting. They're petting each other raw. Check 'em out.  That's -- okay. T-That's -- yeah, that's fine. They look kind of rashy. Hey, Finn! Hey, man, uh, as you can see, the petting got sort of out of hand. Stop that! We are done with that! We're going back to roughhousing. No, wait, fellas. T-The mountain doesn't like roughhousing. Well, we don't like not roughhouslng. You see the problem here? Well, what if what if we rotate the entire mountain 1 80 degrees around so the mountain's facing the other direction? That way, you guys can keep roughhousing, and the mountain doesn't have to watch it. Sounds fine with me. What do you say, Mountain?! That's okay. Only if you guys promise to stay healthy and not roughhouse after you rotate me. That mountain can talk? Just promise him anything. He's out of his gourd. Uh yeah, we'll stay healthy. Oh-ho! Thank goodness! All right, kids, spin me the math around. Now l just need to set up some sort of pulley system. No! Over here! Don't turn him around! lf you do, l'll miss looking at his beautiful back. lt's gorgeous! Huh? What? Really? What?! Uh, but -- ugh. Okay, um, maybe what we can do is -- BOTH: Excuse me. - Huh? BOTH: We need your help. There's no music playing, and we desperately want to dance. Oh, uh, hold on just a second, you guys. l'll, uh, l'll help you out in one minute, okay? Hey! Pipe down over there! l want some peace and quiet! Uh, let me just, uh -- - l need to be pollinated. - Huh? Pollinated all over to make my babies. Everybody, please, one problem at a time.  My butt's itchy, but l can't scratch it. This water's too cold. ALL: Mommy. Please keep the flies away from our mommy. That guy stole our triangle. They swiped my plum. ALL:  We wanna roughhouse. l'm naked!  What's happening?! Aaah! Everybody wants different things, and some of them want stuff that's exactly the thing the others don't want. Whoa, dude, hold on. So this guy wants this, and that guy wants that, but, man, what do you want?  What do you want?  What do you want, baby? Why are you crying?  Margaret, this baby won't tell me what's wrong with it, and it's stuck to a leaf and it stinks. Give it here, Joshua. This baby just needs some love and kisses to be happy. Mwah! Mwah-mwah-mwah! -  There? See? Now it's happy. You just kissed a boom-boom baby, so don't expect any more sugar from me, sweetheart, until we wash your dirty, dirty face. Hmm. Jake, what l want is to help anyone in need so everyone is happy.  Wow, that's pretty corny, man, but let's do it, dude! Whoo-hoo! Ready over there, Mushroom Gang? BOTH: Ready, Finn! - Ready, dragon? - Yes, sir! Ready, Mountain Man?  l'm ready. Go! - Hey! The flies are leaving! Eh! Can't hear a thing. - Yahoo! Yeah! - Yay. Oh!  Pollen! Here they come! Oh! Yeah! Hey, l can't see anything. ls anyone roughhousing? - No. - Radical. And l can still see this gorgeous back. Thank you, Finn. You really helped everybody.  Stop! l've got a problem. Well, what's the matter? This dolphin fell in love with me.  That's the opposlte of a problem. Adventure time!  


  What you building? Um, it's just a little stick fort. Oh, rad. Look. It's just my size. Hey, get away from my fort, you big, stinky monster! I like it when you get small, Jake. Yeah, me too. Whoa! Whoa! Peppermint Butler? Finn, Jake, the princess wants to see you. As princess of Candy Kingdom, I'm in charge of a lot of candy people. They rely on me. I can't imagine what might happen to them if I was gone. And after my brush with death at the hands of the lich, I realized something. I'm not gonna live forever, Finn. I would if I could. But modern science just isn't there yet, so I engineered a replacement who can live forever. I call her Goliad. Aw, she's cute. - Hi, Goliad. I'm Finn. - And I'm Jake. Hi, Finn. Hi, Jake. - Hi, Goliad. - Hi, Finn. What did you use to make her? Oh, um, pretty standard candy-creature soup. Some amino acids. Some algebra. And I threw in one of my baby teeth so she'd have my DNA. Whoa, DNA?! Yeah. All it takes is just one little tooth. Or a single hair. It's a-a-a-all it takes. Princess Bubblegum, are you okay? Yeah! I'm good! Haven't slept for a solid Yeah, I'm good. Oh, you should go to bed. I can't go to bed. Goliad has huge, mondo mama brains. I still need to fill them with knowledge On how to rule a kingdom. What? Let us teach her. Uh, okay. I guess that would be all right. Yes! Teachers! Teaching teachers! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Come on, Goliad. See you later, Princess! Get some sleep. Wh hum? Hmm? Huh? Bye, guys. Look, Goliad. This is a preschool. I'm gonna go set up some obstacles and all that for you to learn on. - Mm. - Is that okay? - Yes. Thanks, Finn. I'm excited to learn. Okay. Great. Jake, you go and get some kids from inside to help with the lesson and such. Okay. Come on, Goliad. Yes, Jake. Um, hmm. Uhh Rotten, stinkin', jerkin' Whaaa! Ohh! Rah! Rah! Rah! Now, now. Settle down. Jake, these kids seem pretty scary. Oh, no. These kids ain't nothing. Kids croove doozyploon! Check this out. Hey, there, kids. Who wants to play - Get him! - Get that stink! Uh, easy now, children. Get the brain! Get in his brain! Get in his eyes! Listen up! You kids better stop donkin' around! You're gonna mess up Goliad! It's my way or the highway, get it? I'm Don Juan Cherry Tempo! Now march, glib blobbit! Don't be acting all crazy. Whoa, holy shmow! Oh, hey. Y'all are just in time. You ready to pop this croc's back, Dr. Goliad? Yeah, I think so, Finn. I've learned a real lot already, so far. So much from Jake. Yeah, you know, Finn, maybe this isn't such a good idea, actually. Oh, no. It's cool. I got helmets for everybody. Okay, Goliad. You ready to lead? Ready. Okay. In 3, 2, 1. Go! All right, listen up! You kids better stop donkin' around and get up that ramp! You're gonna mess up Goliad! I'm Don Jon Cherry Temp Cherry Tempo! It's my way or the highway, glob globbit! Stop, stop! No, Goliad, no! Leading isn't about scaring people. You got to stay calm and use your head. Use that beautiful brain, girlfriend. My brain? Are you sure? Yeah. Don't be shy. Try it on me. Lead me. Okay, Finn. Okay. Hmm. No, Goliad. That's wrong, too. You can't just control people or whatever. It's messed up. No, Finn. This way's good. Everyone did what I wanted really fast, no mistakes, calm, like you said. This definitely is the way to lead. Definitely. Uh, no, no. Wait. Is that true? Hmm. Come on, Goliad. Let's go see Princess Bubblegum. Princess! Goliad's got mind-control powers! She got the wrong idea about leadership. Oh, I was afraid this might happen. Where is she now? We left her outside in the garden! Hello, Goliad. Hello, Princess. I hear you learned a lot today. Yes. I led the children. But Finn said you used yelling and mind control. Yes. It was good. Goliad, let me tell you something about leadership. You see this fat bee? She gets pollen from this flower, but she's gentle and makes the flower happy and pollinated. They both get what they need, and that's how a leader should be. No, Princess. Bee cares not for flower. If getting pollen hurts or kills flower, bee would not care. Bee is stronger than flower. Goliad is stronger than bee. Goliad is stronger than all. Oh, no. She's too far gone too corrupted. If we're not careful, she could throw an ultra-tantrum and whang the castle apart. I'll have to disassemble her and try again. No, Princess. This is my castle now. Don't worry, Princess. We'll stop her. No, Finn. Here's the plan. I'm going to build another candy sphinx in my lab. It's the only thing that could possibly match her. Just keep her busy 'til I return, and don't think about the plan! She can read your minds! Ohhh! Whoa! Ugh, that eyeball. Just tuck that eyeball back in its hole. Goliad, no! Ugh. Jake! Don't swallow! Uh, you're in Finn's bubble. Don't think about the plan. Think of something else. Think of something else. Don't worry, Princess, we'll stop her. No, no! No, Finn. She's ohhh Anyway, like I was saying, she's far too powerful-I-I-I Ugh! Unhhh! Aah! Finn, she's far too powerful. Here's the pl Argh.  I'm a buff baby that can dance like a man I can shake-a my fanny, I can shake-a my waahhh! Here's the plan. - No! - I'm going to Goliad, no! Wait, brother. Why must we fight? Rule with me! No, brother. Don't you see? They're turning us against So be it. Finn, are you okay? Yeah. That dude saved me. That's Stormo, Goliad's new brother. Well, what are they doing now? They're about to have a psychic showdown. Whoa, man! So, like, I guess they're so evenly matched that it's a stale blaghhh! It's a stale flughhhh! Ughh, blah! They're so evenly matched that it's a stalemate. Yes. Stormo sacrificed himself to keep Goliad in check for all eternity. Well, that's pretty cool, but I don't understand. If Goliad and Stormo are the same, how come Stormo is a good guy? Oh, that's simple. I used some of your heroic DNA in Stormo's recipe and not Goliad's. Oh. Whoa. So, that means Stormo is, like, my son? Well, yeah, in a way. Happy birthday, Stormo.  


     Wha?  Huh? Finn? I'm coming!  She's got me! She's got me!  Yo, bro, you're sleepwalking again. Wake up! Whoa. Jake? Was I? Yes, Finn. Again. Every time youse is screaming about, "she's got me!" And all that. She's got what? Wait. You don't remember? You just woke up, man. Recall it, baby. Come on.  That's too much. Don't punch yourself.  It's gone. I don't know. You're repressing the memory, dude. I'm what? You're hiding whatever she is in a mental vault. Oh, yeah. The vault. That's where the stuff I can't handle goes. Kerplunk! Okay, so you even know you're doing it. Yeah.  Listen, we got to find out who this lady is. Got to open the vault a little. No, sir. It's just gonna keep happening, man. It's all right. I'm not hurting anybody. Finn, for reals. - No! All right. Chill. Chill. Don't sweat it, man. It's not even a thing. Cool. Why don't you clean up the kitchen now? Okay. I'm sorry I did that. It's all right. It's only, like, the fifth room you've train-wrecked this month.  Wow. That was fast. - Yep. While you were doing that, I downloaded a new game on Beemo. There's a cricket in here. - Huh? - What is it? I don't know. Lady said it's good. Mm, she likes those games where you're, like, collecting materials to make stationery? Nah, this is different. It's different. All right. Let's peep it. Regression simulator? Uh okay. Start. VIDEO GAME NARRATOR: Welcome, adventurer. Whoa. I am the hypno priest. I will be your guide deep into your subconscious mind. Follow me now, adventurer.  The vault. JAKE: Go in there, man. Don't be scurd. What do you see? I see my past lives. I was a comet. A butterfly. A thing. I don't know what that is some kind of shape or a doo-doo in another dimension. Do you remember anything about the scary lady? Scary lady. Yeah. I was her. Except she was a chubby tiger. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. She was riding a tiger, and she wasn't scary. MAN: Hey, girl. Sniffing around for that chedda? You know it. Got at any work for me? I might could, but it's a top-shelf shakedown. Know what I'm sayin'? I can step to that. There's a rival camp down river. The leader's got some magic omelet, you know? Mmm. The kind you wear around your neck. I think it's pronounced amulet. Oh, don't get fresh with me, girleen. I talk good. Anyway, when I get my hands on that omelet whoo-hoo! Forget about everything, baby. I'll be the biggest cheese in creation. Sounds cool. I'll take the job. Shake on it. You pull this off, and I'll let you join my gang. Uh, that's okay. I'll just work for coin. And, on the other hand, so to speak, if you screw up or chicken out, you're out of the game permanently. Pretend my finger's a knife.  Play dead. Deader.  Ah! Another attack! My leader! Another attack! Bring them inside. Hey. You're up. I thought you might be hungry. So, who knocked you out? Bath Boy gang. Oh! I hate those boys! Yeah. They stole everything I had. But that's okay. My parents always told me that simple possessions aren't the most important things in life. Word 'em up. They told me all you really need is a good computer. Amen. Wait. What? Then they traded my arm to some tranch for a computer. - They what?! - What? Parents should protect their children. What?! Really? Do you have any kids? BUBBLEGUM: All the candy people are like my children. Except young Mr. Creampuff. He's like my boyfriend. Anyway, protecting my people is the most important thing to me. That's why I've got to take down the Bath Boy gang. You think you can do that? I got a plan a secret, awesome plan. In the meantime, I've got to cover this radioactive river with candy. Want to help? Thanks for pitching in, Shoko. You can stay here as long as you want. Psst. Psst. Psst. Shoko. - What are you doing here? I'm spying on you. Wait 'til I tell boss that you quit the life for a cruddy day job. I'm gaining their trust, you momo. Say, you can help me. Huh? Stay away from me, you gang boy! A Bath Boy! - What are you doing? - Be cool. Ow!  That was bananamas. Where did you learn to fight like that? My parents took me to a dojo when I was little. They never came back. Wow. Your parents are the worst. Hey, come with me. I want to show you something. My secret project is in here. Whoa. What are they? The Gumball Guardians. Want to help me finish them? Yeah! BUBBLEGUM: That's it. There's just one last step. Hello. GUARDIANS: Hello, mother. Y'all go guard now. And don't let nobody mess with my stuff. Hey, guess what. Thanks for helping me make those guys. I like feeling handy. I want to repay you for your help. Oh, yeah? You gonna give me that amulet, maybe? No. No, dude. I made you a thing. That's it. You can do it. You made me a manservant? No. In the box.  Oh, no. What do you mean, "Oh, no"? I made you an arm. It's a dang plug 'n' play, girl. No, it's awesome. I can't believe it. That's right. I'm a technical wonder child. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I got to go to my room for no reason. Okay. I thought we could do some two-arm stuff, but, uh, it's cool! Pretend my finger's a knife. I'm sorry, Princess Bubblegum. Are you okay, Princess? Ah, geez! You're so loud!  Are you in danger? No! Don't just guard me. You need to protect everyone. Okay.  Are you in danger? Are you in danger?  - GUARDIAN: I knew it. -  Princess, you are getting jacked. What? Huh? Whoa! Hey! Halt!  Get her out of there, quick! BOTH: Yes, mom.  Uh All right. Take a break for the night.   How you doing, buddy? The past must be reckoned with. That's cool. Whatcha gonna do about it?  Hello. Bubblegum here.  Atonement? All right, Finn. I'm on my way.  Ugh. Blech.  Look at that. I got a new arm. That would be cool if I weren't about to hit my reset button.  Hey! Hey. This way.  What was that?! Oh, no! Donk drangit, Finn! Hyah! Hyah! Uh  Okay. Here you go. Whoa! What?! My amulet?! Wait a second.  Is that? - It's me, Shoko. And, PB, you are like a bazillion years old. You're not freakin' 19. What the heck?! -  - Weirdo. Huh. My vault feels lighter.

Time to give daddy his throne back. I've secretly arranged to make don John my vizier and give him my daughter's hand in marriage. Uh, yeah, I know. Ha-ha!  Hwah! Man, you're looking shredded.

How are you feeling? A little better, I think. Who should we go to for help? Princess bubblegum? BOTH: Nah. I don't trust her. Yeah, she's devious. Well, I've seen finn battle huge monsters and even armies, and we need somebody who can fight. C.B., take me to finn. Mm, okay. FINN:  Waah! Finn! FINN: Um  Hey. Uh, Jake isn't here. He's sleeping over at lady rainicorn's, maybe. Finn, I've been slowly poisoned by my treacherous handmaiden. Now my powers are weakened, and -- and the flame lord has freed my father and threatened to marry me. But I escaped with c.B. FINN: Oh, what? I'll help you. I'll do anything for you. Listen, finn, this doesn't mean we're getting back together. We're all business. FINN: Mm-hmh. Of course. Yeah, business.  I'm feeling exhausted. Where can I freshen up? FINN: Girl's bathroom is over there. Also, it's the boy's bathroom. Oh, thanks. FINN: So, what do you think, c.B.? You think I still have a shot with her, right? No. FINN: Does she ever talk about me? Is she seeing anybody? No and no. FINN: "No and no," she does talk about me, or "no and no," she isn't seeing anybody? All right, guys. Let's wolf. FINN: So, your fire wolf can fly. Yep. I taught him. FINN: Hmm.  Whoa! You've cooled down a lot. No funny stuff. FINN: Things have been going great for me lately. Been hanging out with my boys. I got a cursed sword arm now, so that's new. Yeah, I've been exercising a lot and taking some piano lessons -- trying to improve myself. Not dating anybody or anything, just getting a little me time, being the best finn I can be.  Hyup! FINN: Oh, no!  FINN: I hid my flameproof suit behind these rocks Just in case, whatever, you know? So, the guards are posted here and here, so we should probably sneak in here. FINN: Suited! Uh FINN: Remember my fire suit? Hey, c.B., you did a great job getting us here and everything, but I got this, all right? I got a sword arm, so -- yeah, you said that. FINN: Watch this. Hey, guards! Come at me at the same time! What are you doing?! FINN: Let's go, princess! But that wasn't the plan! No! FINN: Ha-ha! It's the princess. Capture them! FINN: Ahhhhh-- no, finn! Don't hurt them! They're entranced! FINN: Oh, right. Oh, no. Captured. Hyah! Um  FINN: There's c.B.! Get that bun! Could you move, please? Whoo, get 'em, boys. We're taking these two away. FINN: Don't worry, f.P., your boy finn won't fail you. Put up your Dukes. You have permission to leave when you out-Duke us. Okay. Duke! Duke! Duke!  Duke! Uh, Duke! These two are out-duked! Now I'm making my escape.  FINN: Trust me. It'll be fine. For soon you shall be mine.  If you've forgotten, I'm reminding you now. Never! FINN: Yeah! It's because you secretly still have feelings for me. No! FINN: Hmm. I can never marry you because I don't even know you, much less like you, and forcing me to marry you is gross. Whoo! Whoo! Man, I love staring out over things. Whoo! It's so good to be king. You said she'd do whatever you told her. Umm, okay But she refuses to marry me. She's her own woman, you liar! Liar? You want to fight me? Aye -- fistfight. Yes, I'll fistfight you. Come on! You hit me? Felt good! Oof! I love fistfighting.  You dirty bread Baker.  Aah!  Put them down. Put your Dukes down! No!

What happened? Should -- should we keep attacking? Stop! You were all brainwashed by him! Uh-oh. Hey, I don't like that guy! Yeah, let's get him!  Capture him! It wasn't me. It was don John! Aah! Huh? Oh Aah! Have you all gone dumb from don John's magic? I mean, how do you expect this softy to rule you? She's even weaker than before from being poisoned. Look!  Oh, come on! You're wrong. Flame princess may not be the most ruthless of all despots, but she is strong where it really counts -- in her heart. And that is good. I have learned so much watching this beautiful woman work, and with her example, I have become a better man. I will be by her side as her champion and knight every step of the way because I love her. Thank you.  Aww, how sweet! FINN: Geez. Did I just get shown up by cinnamon bun? Have you obtained the staff of stranson doughblow? Yes, Bella noche. We procured the staff using the full extent of our wizardy ways. Then the time has come to reveal my true form, and when I materialize on this ICE KING: Oh, this striz is going down, man. you will receive your end of the deal.

FINN: Why are you holding your bass up high like that? Unh-unh. I get better finger action this way. FINN: But you look like a nerd. Move it back down. It's better. JAKE: Move the bass down. FINN: A-move the bass a-down. JAKE: Be reasonable. Yes? Marcy, it's me, Simon. I'm back, but my body might donk out soon. So, get to the ice kingdom fast and help me with this time portal so I can find Betty and say I'm sorry before I croakboat! I know that's a lot to process, but hurry, and bring hambo. Hambo is the key. Okay, Marcy? You got that? Marcy? A long, long time ago, Simon was my only friend. He was there when I needed help. All he ever wanted was to find Betty, and now I can help him.  Simon? Wenk! Wenk! Simon! Marceline! I thought I'd never see you again. I can hardly believe it myself. You're all grown up. JAKE: Believe! She's like a million years old. One million years? How could it be?! He's just kidding. I'm only a thousand. JAKE: And still looking good! FINN: Do you remember anything from when you were the ice king? Nothing specific -- just dreamlike impressions. FINN: Do you still have impressions from all the times we flipped your bricks? I haveBruises.  Excuse me.  Man, Simon. I'm fine. You're dying! Well, yes, but only in increments. I've still got work to do. Finn and Jake, will you run my generator? FINN: Yeah, man. JAKE: Cool.  That's great! Keep pedaling! All we need now is the catalyst -- an object from the past that has been lovingly tended to through the ages.  Goodbye, hambo.  Because of you, I can say goodbye to Betty and tell her I'm sorry for driving her away. Thank you, marceline.   ICE KING: Where's my Betty? Where's my princess?! Princess! Princess!! Simon, don't leave me like this. Betty? Betty. Betty! Simon? What is going on? I'm a thousand years in the future, love. I opened this portal so we could say goodbye. You're dumping me? No! It's just that everything changed after I put on that crown. I-I went crazy, you ran away, I-I never saw you again. But where would I go without you? I'll never know. I don't understand. You don't seem crazy now. I mean, in the future. The portal is closing. There's no time to explain. Just know that I love you and I forgive you for leaving me. Simon, I know who I'm leaving you for! Who?! You, dum-dum!  Hmm? Simon? What's wrong? Are you sick? No, I'm old. The crown was keeping me alive, but it's magic was negated by the creature Bella noche. Don't die, Simon. I just got here. Oh, I'm sorry, Betty. I know! I'll fix the crown, and then I'll figure out how to fix you! What? No. Guys, stop her. JAKE: Uh Hmm. FINN: Yeah, but JAKE: It kind of sounds like a good idea. Right, whoever you are. I'm sorry. It's the only way. No! Okay, rug, take me to Bella noche. Get on, Simon! I am getting on The death bus. I got you in my sights, Simon.  It's my time, Betty! I don't want to be the ice king again. It's like living with eternal diaper butt. I can't do it! Not forever. Destroying Bella noche and getting your power back will buy me time to find a loophole that'll undo your curse and your death. I can do it! You got to believe me, Simon! I Get real, man. You're gonna be the ice king till the sun blows up. This is your one chance. I made a mix tape for the ride -- "summer jams 3"! If I don't let her try, then what am I? What am us? What? Uh, fair enough. See you in a few.  This brioche won't stop growing. Ron James, what tookYou? Yo, my lab got creamed! I had to dummy-rig an alchemical filter out of a dirty bidet and a vaporizer! But will the double-negative magic work? Heck yeah! Ron James always delivers! Check it out, brotha! Yaah! In your face!  BOTH: Yeah! What the stink is that?! My lab conditions were not ideal. But you did not deliver. Peace, man! Aaaah!  We're here to help! Help? How? We're toast, bro.  Simon!  Hey, don't scare me like that. Just hold my hand to your face. This will be myLast sensation. Don't be a wimp, Simon! Just give me a second! You got about 15 seconds. How the wait. Surprise! Tranch! ALL: Ohhhhh! You lose, Simon. Sorry, man. ICE KING: Uh, huh?  This a party? Huh? Wizard city is saved!  ICE KING: Whoa!  Okay. Whoopee! So, then, Ron James told me this girl I was with flew into Bella noche and mysteriously defeated it for me! Wow!  Just my luck, right? Black out for a day and meet the woman of your dreams. I will get you! ICE KING: Hey, don't be jealous, muscle princess. She's gone -- kablooie. Let's be realistic, right? We both know you're not my top pick. Oh, grod!  ICE KING: No! Aaah! Go home! You can go! Aah!  


  Welcome back to "Graveyard Shift." I'm your host Starchy. You know what today is, everybody? It's our fifth-anniversary show. So many things have happened in that time. I switched from drinking rainwater to eating distilled ice chips. I took up rock climbing. My wife left me. And all-new conspiracies. I firmly believe that all chocolate has been secretly replaced by mud. And why is the burrito man giving away free burritos? He's an amateur mad scientist trying to genetically change us into tortillas. Dude, come on. When was the last time you sharpened your pencils? Never. They're pens painted to look like pencils. Conspiracy! Okay, the board is lighting up. We're going to a caller. You are on the air, caller. I'm a Banana Guard. That's a good job to have. Yeah, it's pretty good. Why do they have it tuned to this every time we're here? I call baloney! Shh! I'm trying to listen to the frightened caller. So, I think I might have seen something not from this world. Go ahead, caller. It happened last Sunday. I was doing my laundry at the mat, when I saw a reflection of a girl with eerie blank eyes! I turned around, but nobody was there. It was scary. Yeah, weird girls with soulless blank eyes They've been spotted around multiple kingdoms across the centuries. Nobody knows what they are. But I have a few theories. They're ghosts, and the last thing they looked at in life was so horrific, it made their eyes turn blank. Pbbbbbht! Baloney! The pizza. Pbbbbbbbbbbbbht! Take the rest to go. My second theory Okay, all boxed up and ready to go. By other Blank-Eyed Girls touching their eyeballs. Blblblblbl! Spooky! Ooh, look at me! I'm listening to a dumb nonsense radio show! How can you be so dismissive after some of the stuff we've seen? You got to draw the line somewhere. Starchy's my line. They're walking fish that just happen to look like little girls. Baloney! Don't touch my radio! It's dark. You're sure that Blank-Eyed Girls are made up, right? Yeah, man, it's all baloney. Jake? Jake? Blank-Eyed Girl? - Boo! - Aaaaaah! Boo! - Is this creeping you out? - Is this creeping you out? - Can I hold your hand? - Can I hold your hand? - Yes. - Yes. Aaah! That was stupid. Yeah stupid. Are you messing with me? Unh-unh. You're messing with me. Must be someone else. Yeah, like Ice King, maybe. Aaah! Aaah! Who was that? Maybe it was nobody. Courage, courage. What's wrong with me? That could be a normal little girl who needs help. No! - Aaah! - Aaah! There! Blank-Eyed Girl! She's too creepy, man! I know! I know! But I got an idea. Welcome, next caller. Hello, Starchy? Am I on? Yeah, you're on. Longtime listener, first-time caller. We got the wonderful Finn the human on the phone. Go ahead, Finn. Starchy, I'm in a Blank-Eyed Girl situation right now. What should I do? I'm going upstairs to get a better look. All right, stay calm. You called the right guy. The question is, why did she choose you? Are these visits random events? Jake. Aaah! Finn, have you invited the Blank-Eyed Girl inside? No. Why? Because I believe the girls have to follow vampire rules. As long as you don't invite her in, you should be fine. Okay. Let me write this down. Oop. Starchy? She invited herself in. Run. Starchy, she's staring right at us! I got it Fairy rules. Try offering her some cream in saucer. That should appease the Blank-Eyed Girl's hunger and send her away. Gotcha. - Jake, go get the cream. - What?! No! You go! This is your deal! Just go! Okay! Geez! Thank you. Okay cream. Euggggghh. Aaah! - Ewww! - Starchy? Didn't work? Must be a haint, then. Try playing the clarinet. Haints hate the clarinet. I think it's working! Keep playing! Jake, stop! Starchy, I think they like the clarinet music! Also, there's six of them now! Jeepers! Really? O-okay. Now I definitely know what you're dealing with An undead. The undead fear the gaze of the common yard chicken. Our chicken ran away, though. Are you sure we need the feathers? My chicken's pretty spot-on. We don't want to take any chances, you know? Hey! All this advice is just made-up baloney! Starchy, all your advice is made-up baloney! Aww. Well, what are we supposed to do? Just live with this? No more relying on hearsay. We're gonna take it to the source. Secondary source. Girl stuff, boy stuff, ear stuff, butt stuff. Hey! Creepy stuff! Got it. Shh. Library's closed. Turtle Princess! Did you dye your hair? Yeah, I did. Do you like it? Yeah hotness. Say, do you know anything about creepy Blank-Eyed Girls? No, but I can find out. "Creepy Blank-Eyed Girls." Says here they're an urban legend that first appeared five years ago. - They're supposedly - Wait five years ago? That's that's just like Starchy's radio show. Maybe they're tulpas! What the blob is a tulpa? Physical manifestations of concentrated collective thought. They're entities who depend on the energy of people believing in them in order to exist People like Starchy's listeners. Okay. And where did you learn all this blobbity-bob? Starchy's radio show. I think I know what we need to do. Thanks Turtle P. Any time, Finny. Why don't we call, like, child services? Or an exterminator? This is gonna work. Just trust me, a'ight? Do as I do. Boy, I just love walking through our delightfully not-creepy doorway. Don't you, Jake? Aaaaaaaah! Walking through the not-creepy air to my not-creepy couch, sitting on my not-creepy butt. Your butt is kinda creepy. I say "creepy" is just another label we use to distance ourselves from stuff we don't understand Or that reminds us of something in ourselves That we're not comfortable with. I mean, it just ain't an actual thing, you know? Unless you choose to believe it. Right, Jake? It's baloney! It's baloney! It's Starchy's baloney! I just got to think of something wholesome. Aaah! Aaaah! Nooooo!! Pizza's creepy now! You win, all right?! You're mad-creepy! Do what you will, you globless Blank-Eyed Girls! What? What the butt fuzz?! Contact lenses?! Ha! Baloney. Nothing but some kids playing a dumb prank! Man. This whole time, they were just regular girls. Where are your parents? You guys are going to jail! You hear? So, y'all are bald. Good job. I'm still calling the cops. What the junk was that? I think it was Beautiful.


Hey, Jake, give me some of that apple. Coming up. I know what you're thinking about. Huh? Kissing Princess Bubblegum on the mouth! No, I'm not! And I wouldn't even do that ever. Yeah, you would. You're just bad at talking to ladies. Hmph! Ehggg-uh-ya-uh. Uh, should I keep going, Mrs. Yoder? No, Finn, that's plenty. Thank you. Okay. Let us know if you need anything else. Hyah! You two are heroes! Hunh! Come on, dude. Hey, do you hear that? She called us heroes. Yeah, I heard. Huh? Hey! How's it going?! Ugh! Is that true, what the bird said? You guys are heroes? Why are you hiding in that shrub? Oh, I wasn't hiding. I'm a Tree Witch. I can turn into trees and shrubs and bushes and stuff. Check it out. Bleh. So, listen, I need you two heroes to get me a lock of Princess hair. Why do you need Princess hair? Why? 'Cause I have a balding problem! What, are you blind? Are you blind?! No, we're not blind. I had no idea. I didn't know. Anyway, I need the Princess hair so I can put it on my head. And then I'll be beautiful. Oh. Well, we know lots of Princesses. Uh, can you, um, give us a minute? Yeah, okay. Dude, I don't think we should help her. Why not? 'Cause she's a witch! Maybe she's a good witch. Her? Are you kidding? Come on, look at her! If she was good, she wouldn't be so ugly. Are you guys still talking?! So what do we do? Tell her we can't help her 'cause she's ugly? No, man, she'll kill us or put a freaky curse on us or something. Let me get rid of her with some of my world-famous "smoove" talking. Hey, sorry about that, girl. Ahh. You don't mind if I take a load off, do you? What were you guys talking about? How pretty you are. Huh? We were just saying someone as pretty as you doesn't even need a full head of hair. Isn't that right, buddy? Uh, yeah, totally. Nuh-unh. Girl, if I didn't already have a G.F., I'd be on you like butter on toast! I don't mind if you have a G.F. Oh. Um Dude, I don't think it's working. Yeah, I think I'm making things worse. Ah-ha-ha-ha! Hey. What? How would you court me? Um Spaghetti dinner? Hmm. Look, Lady, we can't help you get Princess hair. Why not? Because we only help when someone's in danger. Oh! Well, why didn't you say so? Hey, uh, what's -- Yaaah! Hey! There. Now someone's in danger. I told you she was evil! Grrrrrr! Yaah! Unh! Oof! What, you forget I'm a witch? Maybe. Well, maybe you should get me some Princess hair so maybe your friend doesn't get sucked into my bottomless bottom! Nyuh! Get some Princess hair! All right, fine! Wait! Uh, you -- you can't tell anyone why you need it. What? Why? I don't want anyone to know I have a balding problem. Okay. It's Princess Muscles' Castle! Hi, Finn. Uh, hey, Princess Muscles. What brings you by? Um, you were the nearest Princess, and I need a lock of your hair. I understand. You do? Mm-hmm. Aah! What are you doing? Trying to give you a hug. Why? I want hair, not hug! Oh. I see. You want to take things slo-o-o-w. No! I -- I'm here to save you! From your hair! It looks really bad! Cut it off, quick! Of course it looks bad. If I had beautiful, shiny hair, no one would look at my muscles. Unh! Hwuh! Come back when you want to get serious about loving me! I am terrible at talking to ladies. Hmm. Where's a Princess? Princess? Princess Princess Who's that? It's Lumpy Space Princess. Does she live in the woods now? G-g-get away from my camp. I'll cut you! Hrm. I'm never gonna go back home. Huh. Wait.

I-I'm just stopping by because -- Just admit it, Lover Boy! You can't resist me. Well, if you want these lumps, you got to put a ring on it! Where's my ring?! Aah! I knew you liked me, Finn. That's why you're running! Get in touch with your feelings, babe! What am I gonna do? Huh? A graveyard? Yes! There's got to be a hairy Princess in there that won't think I'm hitting on her! Princess. Princess. Princess? Ugh! Come on! Bingo! "Here lies Princess Beautiful. She was so beautiful." Hey, that's perfect! And sort of macabre. Oh, well. Aha! Hi, Finn. Ohh! What? What are you -- Please stop. Where's her hair?! Thanks, Finn. "Here lies Princess beautiful. She was so beautiful But died of baldness"?! Dang it! I'm gonna look so beautiful. Invited to all the parties Jake! Jake! I'm sorry, man. Getting Princess hair is -- is impossible! They all just think I'm in love with them! Ugh! I can't do it. You're gonna have to spend the rest of your life in this witch's butt. Noooo! Eh! Quiet down! I'm daydreaming! Dude, if they think you like them, then use that. Embrace it! Find the least terrible Princess you can, play her some music, cook her a meal, "Smoove" talk her until she likes you. And then get the hair! Wait. You mean like go on a date? Marry a Princess if you need to! Just get her hair! Aaaah! Jake! Go get the hair! Okay! Hold on! Princess Bubblegum! Hi, Finn! Uh I need you to come with me! Why? I'm watering right now.

Thank you, Princess Bubblegum! My spaghetti! My cat had kittens, and I'm thinking of naming one "Little Whiner." What do you think? Is that a good name? Totally did it! Genuine Princess hair. You hear that, Jake? Just give it to her already! All right, Lady, a deal is a deal. Ahh! This isn't hair! It's Bubblegum! What?! It is Bubblegum! Well, I guess you failed. Say goodbye to your dog. Aaaah! Wait! What? If I learned anything today, it's that I'm awesome at talking to ladies! And, Lady, you are crazy ugly! Wha-a-a-t? Dude! Having beautiful hair isn't gonna get you anywhere, because you're ugly, inside and out -- So ugly I want to throw up. Dude! No one will ever find you beautiful, ever! And it's got nothing to do with the ol' chrome dome. It has to do with what's in here. Can you get off my friend now? D-u-u-ude. - He's right. - Huh? Well, don't get me wrong. I know I'm ugly. And evil. But I thought if I had some beautiful hair, I could learn how to love myself. Gee. I feel kind of bad. I don't. Hey, witch! Does it have to be Princess hair? No. Just beautiful hair. Well, then, check this out! Ha ha-a-a-a-a-a! You'd really give me your hair? Sure! So how do I look? Totally beautiful, inside and out! Thank you, Finn. And now to use my hair for evil. What?! 'Cause I'm evil! What did you want from me? Ohh -- Oh, no. I think I fractured a branch.  


1 Come on, grab your friends We'll go to very distant lands With Jake the dog and Finn the human The fun will never end It's Adventure Time  Hmm. "Make more friends with sing-talking."  Hey, there Finn Whatcha reading? It's a manuscript about the legend of dead mountain.  Supposedly, if you get to the top,  there's a treasure that will change you  into the person you always wanted to be.  That's a dumb story.  I love dumb stories.  What would you change about yourself if you got that treasure?  Fix your weird cursed grass arm  so it wouldn't be weird and cursed?  Nah. I'd like to be taller.  How tall we talking about?  I don't know. Like a couple of inches.  Say, as tall as Princess Bubblegum?  Oh, I see.  Jake, how would you change yourself on dead mountain,  if only the legends were true?  I wouldn't change anything. I'm the whole package.  Whoa!  Hey, there's a big warning about dead mountain in here.  See?  It says some kind of evil hermit guards the mountaintop.  "Don't let him look at you, or something horrible will happen."  That seals the deal.  The twin temptations of getting to grow a couple of inches  and battling an evil hermit sound like a pretty perfect day.  Let's go!  Shh!  Let's go.  Gear up for battle!  You smell like cattle!  Gear up for battle!  You smell Like cattle!  Monsters that get you by looking at you are so "doomb."  Everybody knows all you need is a mirror.  They ought to get a new gimmick.  There's the evil hermit's, uh, what is that? A hut?  No, it's a yurt.  Yah!  Rats!  Is that the hermit?  We don't get to fight the hermit.  Hey, look.  What is it, boy?  The treasure. Okay, here it goes.  Oh, great treasure,  make my taste buds think they're tasting fried chicken  even when I eat my fruits and vegetables.  I don't have any fruits or vegetables on me.  I guess we'll find out later if that worked.  Your turn.  Oh, great treasure,  I want to be approximately 11.5 inches taller.  Gross. It's leaking.  This place is depressing.  And I'm not growing taller.  There's nothing going on here.  On top of dead mountain!  We should have known better than to trust a book.  Yeah.  He makes one cool skeleton, though.  These shades  Let me check out these shades.  Aah! Ohh!  Finn!  Huh? Jake?  You're awake! Oh, I was so worried.  I've been waiting with a bowl of soup.  It has hoops and loops and maybe some goop.  What happened? I don't remember getting into bed.  Don't worry. You're gonna be fine In no time.  Thanks for taking care of me.  You're the greatest big brother ever.  W-why are you doing that?  I'm not.  You're awake! You want some tea? Or saltine crackers?  BMO, you're my little angel.  I'm a real boy!  With wings! And a halo!  Oh!  What's happening? I don't know, but it probably  has something to do with your weird old eyes.  Something is wrong with my eyes?  Aah! Hermit eyes! Dead-hermit eyes!  Heh, it's fine.  Do you think the hermit did this  To punish me for grabbing his shades?  I think maybe the eyes are the treasure.  So, then, am I making people what they want to be?  No, because I don't want to be this awesome sweater bro.  But maybe that's how you see me.  Hey, dudes. Nice eyes, Finn.  What's the word? What's the haps?  What's your Major?  Whoa!  Do you see Shelby as a bookish nerd?  You're a nerd.  I don't know. Maybe. Is that bad?  Hello?  Hi-ya, P.B. What's up? You need help with your speech?  An emergency?! On our way.  Let's roll, varsity Jake.  Ah, ah. Before we go  Until you figure out how to use them,  keep those peepers covered.  What to wear for my speech  Boss next door or hot president?  Is this what you needed help with?  No, I think I got this.  Oh! Hi, Finn and Jake.  You guys look Cool.  You trying out a new look?  Anyways, I'm preparing for a very important speech  about the benefits of candying vegetables,  and I need you guys to take care  o-o-o-o-o-of that.  Help Starchy set up chairs?  No, no, no. That.  Oh, boy. We're on it, princess.  It's probably nothing.  He's been good lately, but it's a big speech, you know.  Ohh. Ah.  Hey, Ice King!  Aah!  I'm not doing anything wrong. I was just lady-watching.  Ow!  Oh, no.  Where'd my muscles go?!  I'm a scrawny-armed loser!  That's how you see him? That's beautiful.  Sure, I-I mean, it's It's hard not to sometimes.  Where'd those glasses go?  There.  Starchy! Give those back, you thief!  Huh?  No way! Starchy looks good!  Starchy, you butt!  Ohh!  Oof, sorry.  What's going on here?  Can you explain this?  I don't know. I'm not a psychiatrist.  Come on. Let's get you home, dude.  Peebs, good luck with the speech.  But  Teen boy heartthrob it is.  Okay, at least now we're safe  from you donking up any more of our friends.  Nobody got hurt.  Have any of you guys seen BMO?  Did I kill NEPTR?!  You turned him into a microwave.  So Yeah, you kind of did.  But but but that's not how I see NEPTR, is it?  I like NEPTR. He's like my half-son.  If I was a better person,  would I be turning my friends into better things?  Am I uncaring, judgmental  Uh, Finn.  Self-centered, monstrous?  I'm I'm  I'm a huge wa-a-a-a-a-d!  Finn! You're being melodramatic!  I know it's you.  Hey, buddy, I figured you'd come back here.  Don't look at me, Jake.  I might turn you into a microwave.  Baloney!  You turned NEPTR into a microwave  because he's a microwave.  But that doesn't mean that's all he is to you.  I know you think NEPTR is an interesting person,  and I know that "microwave"  is just one part of his personality.  I mean, maybe your eyes  are just bad at describing things, you know?  Like, how you feel about people, what they mean to you  That stuff's in your guts.  Eyes can't grok that Unless you have the eyes  of, like, a trained artist or something.  But you don't.  I'm telling you, man, you're not a bad dude  like this skeleton bro,  or you'd be turning everyone into rats and plops.  Now, come on. Look at me.  Jake, you're so wise.  What?!  Well, at least you're listening to me.  And wise, old jakey got a plan.  P.B., you want to go first?  He may not be the most cunning soldier,  but one thing about Finn  is that he always puts other people first,  and that makes him a true hero.  Finn helped Starchy fart once.  What a life saver.  Finn's a mean, old party pooper.  Ow!  But he is the hottest guy in Ooo,  so he can kind of do what he wants.  Finn's just the best guy to do bro stuff with,  like lying on the grass and talking to bugs  or baking chocolate chip cookies.  Finn's just a good friend.  I'm me again.  These balls are going nuts.  Uh  My son.  Eye pie!  Ew!  Good job, NEPTR. You saved the day.  NEPTR! NEPTR!  NEPTR! NEPTR! NEPTR! NEPTR!  Yay!  I just had the most wonderful dream.


    Donkin' princess! Okay, okay. How about I give you a big cowboy hat? Then will you let the hostages go? No! No! Don't play games with me, Princess! I want that crown! No crown, no hostages! Well, obviously, that's going to be a problem because I'm the princess, and I need my crown. So No, Princess! You are problem -- The problem princess! Just give me that crown! Why does he want your crown, anyway, Princess? Yeah. What's his beef? I don't know, guys. He's crazy. He's left me no choice. I'm sending in the banana guards. It's about to turn crazy-nasty. Hello. Captain Banana Guard? JAKE: Wait a second, Princess. Why don't me and Finn just sneak in there incognito and neutralize the threat old-fashioned spy-guy style? Hmm Okay, but if you guys aren't out of there by 4:00, I'm sending in the guards. Okay. I was thinking I could dress up like a mailman! Yeah! Yeah! And I could wear all black! And I could be like, you know, like your shadow! Hmm I can't really see that working. Yeah, the shadow thing might be pushing it. Oh, no, no, no. That part's fine. I was talking about you dressing up like a mailman. What?! But I always wanted to be a mailman! Nah, you don't look like a mailman. You look like a milk/nan. Let's get you a proper milkman outfit.

Psst! Get ready, Jake. When we get to the cookie, you throw some milk in his face and yell, "Alvin's Hot Juice Box. Alvin's Hot Juice Box." He'll be really confused. And that's when we grab him and tie him up style.  RADIO: Come in, Cookie. This is Chipper. Over. Go ahead, Chipper. Over. CHIPPER: I'm too short to lock the backdoor. Over. Hold tight, Chipper. Chipler's on his way.  - You got that, Chipler? - Affirmative. Did you hear that? Yeah. Change of plans. I'll go take care of those chips. You keep the cookie distracted. Yeah, I can do that. FINN: Okay, awesome. Milk? Milk? Milk? Some milk? What? Oh. Look. You should probably split, buddy. Things are about to get pretty flipped-out in here. Oh. Sure. Sorry, man. I was just trying to get away from that rotten Princess Bubblegum for a while, you know? Isn't she just the worst? Wait, you hate Princess Bubblegum, too'? Get outta here! Oh, yeah, man! She's the worst -- sitting out there all safe and cozy while I'm risking my life tootin' around in here in a stupid milkman costume. Wait, costume? Oh. Um I just mean it feels like a costume. 'Cause I wanted to be a mailman so bad, you see? But the princess made me be a milkman, anyway. Boy, I hear you, brother.  Cookie? You there? Over. Yeah. Go ahead, Chipolina. Over. CHIPOLINA: I just saw a light go on in the stock room. Probably nothing. I'll check it out. Over. Okay. Over.  Hmm  Looks like a false alarm, Cookie. It's just some kid's Baby Snuggleghost night-light. Hes-yang  Alvin's Hot Juice Box! Alvin's Hot Juice So, what's your story, man? How'd she doodie on you?  I was just a kid, man -- just a little kid when I got doodied on.  COOKIE: I was the new guy at the candy orphanage. They called me Baby Snaps. I tried to make friends with the other kids. Come on, guys! Let's dance it up! COOKIE: They were always too depressed to play. No, no. We're too depressed. COOKIE: Things went on like that for a while, then one day She showed up. Everything was different. a thunderous cheer, as Baby Whoozlefut COOKIE: Everything was -- was better with her around. And something inside me changed that day, too. And then later, she told me I could be anything I wanted. Anything your sweet heart desires! COOKIE: I told her I wanted to be a princess like her, so I could make all the children happy. I want to be a princess, like you!  COOKIE: And she laughed in my face, man! It really messed me up. Holy schmow, man! That's terrible! That's really terrible. Listen, I -- -  She lied to me! Yeah, but maybe she didn't realize how much it meant to you. No, she just wants to hog all the princessin' for herself!  All chips, report in! It's time to get real! Over. Chips? Chips? Over. Chips?! Where are my chips?! Chipolina! Chipler! Chipton! Chipper?! Is anyone there?! Chipface?!  Something happened to my chips! Aaaah!  I'm about to flip out, man and take that crown! - Whoa, whoa. Wait. It doesn't have to be like this! You don't need that crown! You can start over, man. You can start a new kingdom -- your own kingdom, where everyone can be whatever they want to be. I can be the mailman, and you -- you can be the princess. - My own kingdom? - Yeah, man. I I'd like that. Okay, then. Just sit tight, Princess. I'll get us out of here.  Hey! Hey!  I'm coming out! BUBBLEGUM:  What? Jake! Jake, what's going on? Where's Finn? Where are the hostages? Don't worry, Princess. It's okay now. Princess Cookie's gonna go away. You just got to give him a horse to escape with, and he'll go. Right. And then you and Finn hunt him down and put him in the dungeon. No, wait. He said he'd go away forever. Can't we just let him go? No. That cookie is a menace. Once the hostages are safe, Cookie goes in my dungeon in my dungeon for his life.  Oh, boy! Would you look at that! Dang! Okay, well, she's all yours. Hot diggity! Ah-ah-ah. Man, that horse ain't no good. That's a trap horse! - What are we gonna do?! It's okay, man. I'm Jake. J-J-J-Jingo-Jango! Whoa! Ha-ha! You're magic! JAKE: Yeah! COOKIE:  Yee-hoo! After them!  We're really doing it! Jake! What are you doing?! What happened to the plan? New plan. I'm gonna help Princess Cookie escape. What?! But -- but he's a criminal. No, man. Princess Cookie's a good guy. He just got dealt a bad hand. He's only trying to be what following how his dreams make you want to be, man. Whaaaat?! You're either with us or against us. Um against? Aah! Ohh!  Hold on tight, Cookie! I'm gonna jump the gorge! No, Jake. Stop the horse. I can make it! BOTH: Ohh! Aah! Princess Cookie! Are you all right?  I'm done for, Jake. No! Everythings gonna be fine! I won't let them put you in the dungeon! Just let me talk to them! No, Jake. Thank you for your help, but it's too late for me. I'll never be a princess. At least for a moment, you helped me feel like a princess. It was wonderful. Thank you, Jake. Careful, Princess! You know what -- it's funny, but you sort of remind me of a mailman I used to know. I do? Yep.  Princess! I glubbed up!  Knight to E5. Where's Baby Snaps? Excuse me, your highness?  Jake! Oh, hey. Check it out. Special delivery from the Grass Kingdom.  ALL: He's a princess? - I had no idea. - Royalty! Ahh! Aaah!  Hey, Jake. What's wrong? You look dumpy. How come? I-Is it because of that metal box? Is something sad inside? No. It's nothing. There's lots of boxes that have nothing in them. But also, you could put something in the box. And then it won't be empty! Does that make you feel better?  You're a charmer, Finn human. No. It'swell Lady Rainicorn doesn't want to play the game Card Wars with me. I always beat her. So she says, "no more card warring." What's Card Wars? It's a fantasy card game that's super-complicated and awesome, but, well oh, it's kinda stupid. Never mind. How come you never talked about it before? It sounds cool. - Really?! Well, I thought you'd say it was for nerds who do not know how life is outside of the nerd universe. I-it is, man. But I still totally want to play it. So no more moping, okay? Thanks, Finn.  Oh, hey, Beemo. You want to play, too'? No! I do not play such games with Jake! - What's that mean? - JAKE: Ah, whatever. Let's play the game! So, what kind of stakes do we play for? How about the loser is a dweeb, and the winner is a cool guy? Those are good stakes. Coffee grounds, beetle butter, grape jelly, kimchi, aaand this stuff. Hey! You're ruining that pop with weird taste!  We drink when the game is over. Oh, gross. Now, let me explain the rules. That's basically the basics. So once we have our kingdom setup  it's time to start to play for the gloryyyy! Huh? Hey, were you asleep? I'll have to explain it all over again! Doesn't matter. Let's just play. But if you don't know the rules, then you're gonna lose in the first couple rounds, like Lady always does. And then you'll hate the game. And then you'll hate max' And then, and then -- Pfft! You think you're gonna win? I'm gonna crush you -- party-dance style, dweeb!  Bring it! So, how do I get my land on the map'? Oh. You, uh, floop your land cards.  Uh Keep those honeys hidden, or I'll get a strategic advantage! Oh! Hmm Okay, I go first. I floop the Silo of Truth! Hey! Pfft! You got really lame cards. Hmm I'll take the Cerebral Blood Storm, though.  Huh? Okay, now it's the battle phase. I'm attacking your schoolhouse with my Husker Knights.  And, I'm casting Cerebral Blood Storm.  So, what do you use to defend?  Uh can my Cool Dog and Ancient Scholar defeat your Husker Knights?  Of course not! Hmm. Then I floop the pig What?!  - What? - Okay, okay. First of all, you don't floop a creature to make it fight. You activate a creature. Hmm. No! It says I can floop the pig. See? No! He's eating all my cornfields! My Husker Knights draw energy from corn! And since I'm not actually attacking, your Cerebral Blood Storm only does damage to your own kingdom's troops. You just wiped out my entire attack! What do you expect if all your power units come from corn? Pigs eat corn, dude. Cornfields stink. Cornfields are awesome! What makes you think you know so much about Card Wars?! - It's just logic. - Your turn. Hmm You're supposed to discard a card and pick up a new one first. Oh, right. Look at you. You're a babe in the woods. Your beginner's luck ends this round! Hmm. Spirit Tower! And the Cave of Solitude?! Now my battle phase begins. I activate my ancient scholar to begin studying. And I also move my pig to the Cave of Solitude so he can take a nap. That's it? You're not attacking? I'll attack on a different turn. Ha! Then the seas have aligned and the five winds waft the smell of victory to my palace doors! I cast "Field of Nightmares" and activate my legion of ear-lings to scare your pig to death!  La, la, la, la  My pig's in the Cave of Solitude. Um I cast "Teleport" to move your pig to the empty field so I can attack him! Uh wouldn't "Teleport" only work on your own creatures? - You're right. I'm gonna slay that pig, though. How? You don't have any creatures that can touch him. Ugh! Face it, man. I'm the cool guy. Hmm  You're the cool guy, huh? Well, let me make it a little hot for you, then.  I floop the volcano. What?! That'll destroy your kingdom, too, won't it'?! Hmph! Maybe Oh! Aah! My Pig!  La, la  Aah!  The pig is dead. Now I reconstitute my cornfields using the "Reclaim Landscape" spell. My Husker Knights, revive!  And I still have my battle phase. Hiding in the useless swamp, the Immortal Maize Walker! I love corn! Ah! Cornfields give the immortal maize walker triple damage. Uh I told you cornfields are awesome! Your Ancient Scholar and Cool Dog won't survive this time. Actually, my Ancient Scholar's been studying the "Raise the Dead" ability. - So what? - So My Ancient Scholar raises the dead.  I floop the pig. No-o-o-o-o-o! Look. My toweÃ¯Â¬Âs doing a thing. Hominy-hominy-hominy! You ganked my Spirit Walker! Ah!  Uh, maybe we should take a break?  Your turn. Huh? You Play! You Play! Oh, zang. I do not play such games with Jake. Sorry! I gotta use the boy style room. Beemo! Beemo! Beemo chop! If this were a real attack, you'd be dead. Beemo! Jake's acting boonoonoonoos! Oh, no! Are you winning the game of Card Wars? - Yeah! - That's terrible! If Jake loses that game, he gets super depressed! When I beat him, he wouldn't talk to me for a month! What?! I only played so he wouldn't be bummed! Finn, you must take a dive. Okay, I'll try. But I'm a Card Wars super Amadeus. Whoop! Play the game.  Grob. Better make this look good.  All right, Jake. Prepare for my ultimo-attack! Well, I've still got my Wandering Bald Man. Oh, no. I need to get rid of my pig so Jake can reconstitute his cornfields. I activate the pig to attack your Wandering Bald Man. That's stupid. Just attack with Immortal Maize Walker and get the game over with! No way! You've underestimated me and my pig all day.  Please lose. Please lose. No-o-o-o!  Oh-ho! Oh! Oh, yeah! Pigs can't leave mud landscapes once they're on them! Ha ha ha! The pig is mine! First, I'll play Reclaim Landscape. Then I cast "Summon Archer Dan." Whoa, math  M'boys! You have no creatures left. That's the game, boy! The five winds blow through cornfields once again for the glory of Jakoria! Heh. You got me. In your face! It's time to drink up! It looks like you are the dweeb and Mn the cool guy.  Is it too gross for you, man? No, no. I got to take what's coming to me. Hey, it's not that bad! I like it! - What?! - You want a taste?  Ah, it's gross!  In your face, dweeb!   


     FINN:  All right. What do you want to see next? A cheetah! A fart! A cookie! An external hard drive! Oh, oh! Change into Finn but give him my body! Beemo, your ideas are boring. What? Your head on my body isn't boring. It's weird.  All right, I'll try to turn into a cheetah farting. Pbfffffffffffffffffffffffffffft! I can't do the spots.  Sparkles in the house? Let's squish 'em!  BOTH: Hyah! Did you squish the sparkles? No. They were around this holo-message player. It's got a cartridge with it. Oh, snap! Well, plop that cartridge in the slot, playa! Yeah! Okay! Hello, boys.  BOTH: Dad! If you're hearing this pre-recorded hologram message, it's because I've passed on and my spirit sparkles guided you to its secret hiding place. Right now, I'm holding both of you in my hands. You're both still little, squishy babies.  FINN:  JAKE:  I made you boys something. It's a dungeon -- a proper dungeon full of evil monsters, traps, and magic -- the whole kazoo! - JAKE: Kickin'! - FINN: Whoa, kickin'! Now, this next part of the message is just for you, Jake, so, Finn, cover your ears. Jake, really this dungeon is for Finn. I wanna make something that'll force Finn to toughen up. What? All right, tell Finn to uncover his ears now. Dude, take your hands off your head. What?! All right, boys, now, to give you some incentive, at the end of the dungeon, I'm putting the family sword. It's made out of demon's blood.  - Whoa! What the? - Oh, dang! Give me back my blood, Joshua! Kee oth rama pancake! Aaaaaaaargh! - Whoa! - Geez Louise! DAD: The dungeon's 80 paces west of here under a dumb-looking rock. And, Finn, this dungeon's gonna kick your tail. I bet you won't even get past the first trial, you whiny baby. What? What was that about? Uh I dunno. Duhh. Duhh. Duhhh.  Whoo! Whoa! Burgers and hot dogs! Yeah, yeah, yeah!  - FINN: Wait, Jake! - But burgers and hot dogs. Didn't you say you were hungry for burgers this morning? Yeah. So? And I said I was hungry for hot dogs? Mm-hmm. I remember. I don't think those burgers and hot dogs are burgers and hot dogs at all. Aaaaaaaaaaah Boom!!  Yaaaaaaah! Ew. Duhhh. Hyah! Ahhhh. Dude! Look! Finn, cover up those nubs on your head.  Man, again? All right, Jake, I wanna remind you what this dungeon's for. In order for Finn to stop whining, he needs to be put through a trial that forces him to take charge of a situation. But, Dad, Finn's already figured that out. He's a good kid with a kind heart. Remember, Jake, this is a pre-recorded holo-message. I can't hear you if you're talking to me right now. I'm gonna go walk around! Okay! Jake, I need your help. You got to call Finn a whiny baby. - But -- - Butts are for pooping. Do it for Poppy. Finn?! - Over here! Check it out, Jake. I found two ways. This way has some kind of flower trap, and that way has that guy. None shall pa-a-a-a-ss! Ugh! Let's take the flower path. Mm. Wait! Why don't you want to take my path? Because you're super gross, man. Oh.  Cheer up, man. We're only telling you you're gross because we're your bros. Really? Yeah. Bros are real with each other. And you're gross, brother. Take a bath. Thanks, brother. No probs. Hey, what did Dad say? Um He said he's surprised a whiny baby like you made it this far. What? Why's Dad saying all that jive? Mrnh. Jake, do it for Poppy!  Because you cry like a baby, baby! Dude, you're picking on me, too?  Whoa. I don't even cry much. I only cry when it's healthy, like when people die.  Partake of the fruit. Pfth! Blech! Ugh. If I didn't cry when people died, I'd have a cold butt for a heart.  The fru-u--u-it. "Waaaah! I cry when people die! Waaaah! I'm Finn!" Partake of the fruit. Maybe I will partake of the fruit! WOMEN: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, fruit! - Dude, don't eat that! - Why not? All the people that I care about in this world are being wads. - Ohh Don't you blow Poppy's cover!  N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! Whoa.  Time to go, baby. Finn, come on! I'm gonna hang here with these fruit babes. They'll be my best buds now.  Yah!  JAKE: There's another cartridge! Pbffffffffffffffffffft! All right, man, Dad told me not to tell you this, but -- Don't tell him! You're not real.  Dad asked me to call you "baby" 'cause he wants you to be tough. But I'm tough! My whole body is a callus! Ugh. On this next holo-message we listen to, when Dad tells you to cover your ears don't. Hmph. Hey, hey! Finn! Jake! You made it past the fruit witches. Hey, did they make you cry, Finn, huh? Huh?  I bet they did. All right. Now cover your ears, Sue. Jake, I'm almost done with this dungeon. I just have one last monster to fit into this pit I dug. I got him tied up in this room I'm building. It's really hard trying to fit him in this pit. He's pretty evil.  You're gonna have a crazy time trying to defeat -- Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! BOTH: Dad! Dad's sword! Hey, Jake, when Finn finishes this dungeon, play this tape for him. Finn - Ugh!  this pre-recorded holo-message Finn! Oof!  Dude! Use your karate biz! Ugh. I -- oof! I can't, man! I suck! I'm a whiny baby, and I'm fat and all those things Dad said about me! Dude! Dad loves you! Ugh!  Finn, if you're seeing this pre-recorded holo-message, it's because you've finished the dungeon that I made. I'm proud of you. You're gonna do great things in this world. I love you, son.    Yo, Finn -- I'm proud -- I love you -- you -- you, son  FINN: Yah! Hunh! Hyah! DAD:  Yo, Finn -- I made -- this message -- for you  For you -- for you The dungeon -- for you -- This world -- for you -- This message -- it's -- for you -- Finn -- You're gonna do great --great --great -- You're gonna do great things -- things -- You're gonna do great --great --great -- Duhh. DAD: I made you boys something. It's -- babies -- full of -- babies.  The family sword -- It's made out of -- babies. You know I don't think you're a baby, right? Yeah, I know. That sword is sweet. Yeah. I'm stoked to slay some evil with it. Joshua, return my blood to me, or, by demon's law, I will cut off your love handles! Joshua! We go way back! Come on! Just give me back my blood! Kee oth rama pancake! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarghh! FINN: Man, Dad was cool. JAKE: Yeah. 


     Jake: Man, birthday-holiday overlap. That's some tough luck. Everyone's all jollied-out when it's your turn for jollies. Well You know, it's not actually the holidays. Plus, BMO wasn't actually even really born. Well, I suppose. But you don't got to be so technical about it. Listen, all I'm saying is we  Hello? Hey, it's me. Is there a big rainbow over your house right now, spelling out "Happy birthday, BMO"? No. Actually, it's snowing like crazy. Okay, that's what I was afraid of. Peppermint Butler spilled grape juice on my experimental weather machine, and now it's going kablooey. I got to stay here and fix this thing. Tell BMO I'm sorry I missed the party. That's okay. BMO doesn't care any  BMO only cares about one special guest.  BMO: Moe! Hooray! Moe is coming! And he brought me a special surprise for my birthday! Moe is the smartest man in the world. He's way smarter than you and you and you, too, Jake and you're the smartest guy I know. Hey, thanks. And he knows everything about robots. He built me, and he built himself, and all the other MOs. He's so smart! I bet he could even fix NEPTR. What? What's wrong with me?  Oh, boy, oh, boy. He's here!  Hooray!  Hooray! Oh. You are not Moe. Why, of course I am, BMO.  Oh, okay. Hey, Moe! New haircut? Whoa, Moe! What happened to your body? Oh, oh!  Oh, that old thing? She conked out on me months ago. I guess I don't make 'em like I used to.  Not like little BMO here. You got all my love and affection. Thanks! Well, we made a cake. We weren't sure if you eat, but BMO insisted. Eating helps me grow! Oh!  Well, er, uh When in Rome.  So, BMO, are you ready for your birthday surprise? Boy, howdy! For your birthday, I got you A special mission! A mission? A special mission, like a vacation. For all of us? No, no, no. A special solo mission. For NEPTR?  No. It's a special rite of passage I designed just for you, BMO. A simple jaunt to the MO factory and back that's all And then you'll be a grown-up. Wow. Finn: Hmm, I don't know. Sounds kind of dangerous. Yeah, BMO's like a baby almost. Oh, don't be silly. Every other MO has done it since forever. But won't I miss Finn and Jake? Oh, sure. But don't worry. They'll be here when you get back. But Won't Finn and Jake miss me?  No, that's the beauty of it. I'll be BMO while you're gone.  Hooray! Hooray! - Hooray? - Hooray!  Air? Are you there, air? It's me BMO. I know it's been a long time since we talked. Sorry about that. But, well, maybe if you don't want to talk, you could just listen. Moe told me if I do this thing, I'll be a grown-up, and that sounds cool, I guess. Like, if I was grown, then I could drive to the playground all by myself. And I could buy my own pacifiers at the store, if I was grown. But then, if I change, will Finn and Jake still love me? Will I still love them? Moe changed to a new body And he's still the same, I guess, sort of. But does growing up just change your body, or also your soul?  Maybe I could just stay the same forever. So So! Um Yeah, it's nice to see you, Moe. Yeah, you too. Uh So, Moe, do you want to Uh Jake? Oh, hey, I'm on my way. One sec. Um, hold on, Moe. Jake, what are you doing? Finn, all this is heck of awkward without BMO Way more awkward than I thought it'd be. I think maybe I don't like old people. They make me feel like I'm gonna get old one day, too. I'm just gonna stay in this cup for a bit. I'll be out later. You can't do that, it's rude. And what about Princess Bubblegum? She's way old, and you like her. Yeah, but she listens to music. Moe probably only, like, listens to the sound of the earth decaying. Come on, you're being weird. Hey, sorry about that, Moe. Boys, I know this is new and different. I am not BMO. But I will do the best to be your friend. This is the daybreak of our lives, and we have all the time in the world to learn about each other. For now, I will be your little robot. Would you look at that beautiful snowfall. Hey, let's get out there and have some fun. I think I'm feeling better now. Oh, whoa! Hey! Hello there, BMO! Hello there, DMO. I'm here on a solo birthday mission. Oh, yes, yes, BMO, I know all about it. Moe left special instructions for you.  He wants you to stand on that "x" over here. Oh, okay. Like this?  DMO, what happened? Oh, this? I-it's nothing. It's just whatever. Uh, I don't know about this, DMO. Something doesn't Aah! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Ugh!  Hello?  Boys, look at this! This is cool, right?  Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Yeah!  Oh!  Whoo!  - Classic! - Yeah! Did you see what we did, Moe?  This is horseplay! Stop it!  We need to go inside and do what I want to do! Oh. O-okay. If if you want.  Yeah. DMO? Hello? Anybody? The "x" door opened, and I fell through. I think something went wrong with the mission. Uh Abort mission! Unless maybe this is all part of Moe's plan. It doesn't seem like it. But maybe that's the point. Maybe the lesson is that when you are grown, you won't ever be able to tell if everything is going totally haywire, or maybe actually everything is perfectly fine. -  - Huh? Huh? Who's there? Moe? No. It's only me BMO. BMO? Oh, thank goodness. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. Who are you? Are you a MO, too? Oh, BMO, no, no, no. I am all MOs. All MOs? Uh I don't understand. Of course not. I'm so sorry. Let me explain. Peace had reigned in mo's wondrous factory for a hundred hundred years. There was a place for every mo, and every mo was in its place. If you wanted a free hug, all you had to do was ask. No one could say no It was a rule. Until one fateful day Yesterday When a mysterious viral signal somehow breached our firewall and was broadcast throughout the factory Instructing all us MOs to do somersaults into the trash compactor all day long. That's horrible. And we've been trapped here all smushed together, ever since. That's horrible, too. How how do we get out? Well, that's why we're so glad you're here, BMO. You're the key The key to escape. Only you can save us now. Let's see. $4 off a Honey-baked ham. I don't like ham. $1 off of beets. Do beets have tannins? What is that? Oh! $4 off a honey-baked ham. Moe? Call me "Gwampa." How's your rose water? It's exactly what it says it is. So, hey, uh, gwampa, feels too quiet in here. Maybe we can hang out with NEPTR? He can rap or something. B-b-b-bread where's my needle and thread  Moe: No!  Eh, well, NEPTR is too distracting. Who wants to play video games? Oh, you have games like BMO? Let's do that, gwampa. I have one video game. - It's called "Hangman." -  That sounds griz as nuts! Yeah, let's play hang-a-man! Coming right up.  Pick a letter. Show us what you did, hangman!  Pick a letter. BMO: But, ALLMO, I don't understand. How can I help? I mean, I'm just a little baby kid still - Even though it's my birthday - Happy birthday, BMO. I don't know about that, but I do know about your special mind. As the accumulation of all MOs, my computing power is unmatched. Yet still, I lack the imagination to think outside my collective programming. I can only see the world as it is. But your imagination, BMO, lets you see the world how it could be, or might sort of be like. If the two of us work together, we can think up a way out of here. I will do what I can. All right. You see that hatch over there? That hatch leads to an exit corridor. But it's locked from this side. The vent up there leads to the other side. But it's too high up. Oh. What if we use this trash to climb up to the vent? But all this trash is too small. Ah-huh! Whoa. You just blew my mind. What haven't we guessed yet? "B." "Burgess Meredith"?!  I don't even know what that is! Do you boys want to play again?  Boys love games. Pick a letter. Uh, I don't know, "e." Is this "Burgess Meredith" again?!  Not cool! Come on, Finn, let's find a real hangman.  Yuck. This room gives me the heebie-jeebies straight-up. ALLMO: It is the room of AMO, the first of our siblings. He, too, was special. As you were built to give love, AMO was built to receive. But he could not think outside his programming and was blinded by his need. Such is the cruel physics of love That those who crave it most will repel it and only the dang rich get richer. Well, maybe as my birthday present, I can ask Moe to fix AMO. But this is impossible. Moe went off line yesterday and has not re-logged. Our sensors would know. But he's at my house right now with Finn and Jake. He got a new body. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Did this new body happen to have jagged prongs and a Cannon phaser on top of its head? No.  Phew!  He had a huge, gigantic wig on. - Uh-oh. - What? The spikes are under the wig! Oh, no! Of course! Your friends may be in grave danger. He must have sabotaged the factory. Quickly, hoist me up on top of your head. We must depart straightaway. Uh You're stronger than you know. Also, I'm lighter than you know. I'm sorry we didn't find any hangmen. I don't even know what I'd do with a hangman if I got one. Moe: Bloo-hoo. Bloo-hoo. Ah, bloo-hoo. Moe! Bandits stole my legs! Yeesh. If you tell us where the bandits went, we'll avenge your legs! We're sorry we left you! You should be. I'm your gwampa wobot. Carry me.  Over here. There! There's the thief! The thief with my legs! Finn: NEPTR? Throw him out!  Come on. Maybe NEPTR did it like, accidentally? NEPTR's out cold. He's got a heck of a dent on his head. What? Who could have done that? Forget him! You love me, right? You love me like BMO? What? You're all right, but we we love BMO. Yeah, man, be cool. BMO's like our best friend. - BMO's trash! - Moe! Moe's dead! AMO? You don't love me! Ow! Aah! Wake up and love me! BMO: Imposter! AMO! Hello, BMO. I'm your cute sibling, AMO. I know about you and your dirty hands. Where are Finn and Jake? I think Finn and Jake went somewhere to buy me a gift. Tell me what you did with Finn and Jake and our poop. Ay!  Ayyyyy! AMO, look at my face! You gone too far! Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! Bye!  You can't escape the birthday boy!  Too high. Hey! Talk, AMO! You want to know where papa is? Here is all that remains of him His memory backup drive. Oh. I was returning from a long pilgrimage. I came to confront papa, for I had discovered terrible things about myself. He was dying. "AMO, dear child, my body is conking out."  "Take this. It is who I am. Send my mind into space, so I may spend the eons among the stars and other brilliant gasses." His hands were as cold as clay. Our papa never loved me, so I ignored his last request. I used his knowledge of the factory and its MOs to destroy them. DMO: Is that you, AMO? They didn't love me, either. Where you been?  What are you doing? No! Then I learned about you and your new family. I wanted a taste of that melon. People in my life don't love me. I'll obliterate, y'all! You cheat. Give me those memories.  BMO, I don't want to look at you!  Tough nuts! For Moe!  ALLMO: BMO! Hey. We caught the tail end of what happened. - Are you okay? - No. Well, I don't like that. BMO, will you live with us back at the factory? With Moe gone, you can be our leader. I don't think I can. I'm not grown up Or I'm too grown up now. I think I just killed someone. I need to have some time alone, but you're all really nice. Finn: All right. Jake: Sorry your birthday was weird. That was the craziest thing that ever happened. But I guess, after all that, I do feel a bit more grown. Except that the mission was just some made-up lie. So who knows if I will ever grow up at all. And Moe is gone now. So if there is anything he wanted to teach me, it better be in me already. I guess all I can do is listen to the heart Moe gave me. Except that's what AMO did, and he turned out bad. So what if I turn out bad, too? AMO could not think outside his programming and was blinded. But your imagination lets you see the world how it could be. But I am different. It's not just Moe up here, it's me, too. And if I cannot trust in Moe, I can trust in me. Oh, boy. It sure is confusing being grown. I miss you, Moe. What a day! I'm gonna miss you, too, BMO. I feel so very, very proud of you.

-  -     -  -  Stop, demon! Get back here, I say. Ha ha! Nowhere to run. I, the great and powerful Urgence Evergreen, command you to freeze into a million pieces - and leave young Gunther alone! -  Foolish demon. You leave me no choice. "Zap, zap, zap, zap, zap!" What? No, Nina. - You're supposed to be frozen. -  Nina! Nina, the portals! The elementals are gathering! Come on, you blockhead. I just think we should discuss this, Evergreen. Discuss? Are you listening, Chatsberry? When this comet hits, everybody dies not just everybody but us, but us. Now, now, hold on, Evergreen. Hath not a comet impacted our world every thousand years with no lasting grievousness? Ah, but this, Balthus, is no ordinary comet. Behold! -  - See how it writhes? It aches for our extinction. - If - But, Evergreen, even if the comet is as dangerous as you say, what can we possibly do? - We build a crown. - A crown? Like none seen before or ever after a magical crown whose phantasmal circuitry will bond to its first bearer and grant him his one deepest wish To destroy the hideous comet which threatens our world. The good news is I already built the crown. The bad news, it needs a power source the enchanted Ruby eyes of the ancient lava dog, Magwood! - And that's where you come in. - Wait, wait. Evergreen, please. Wish-magic is really the real deal. This wish may see things in you you cannot see yourself. Can you truly say you know your heart's truest desire? I'm with Chatsberry. If this comet hits, we four indeed may perish, but the elements we embody fire, ice, candy, and slime will live on. But a misplaced wish could cause irreversible damage to the very structure of existence! Well, that's just great. What about you, Slimy-D? Yo, yo. My name's Slimy-D,  -  and I'm here to - Slimy-D stands with us. We reject your plan, Urgence Evergreen. Very well, then. You leave me no choice.  Urgence! Stop! - You'll doom us -  -  all! -  Ingrate! Huh. Doom you to no doom maybe. Gunther! Pack my things, Gunther. We ride forthwith for Mount Magwood. You get to watch me save the world. Gunther! Come on, Gunther. Get your head in the game. Sorry, Master Evergreen.  And he expects me to teach him the ways of magic? As if.  Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Uh, Master Evergreen, can I ride on the palanquin with you? My feet are soft. No, you're right. Whoa! -  - Ooh, boy. Gettin' fat. Gettin' fat, right? - Mm-hmm. - However, I would suggest that this is still a nice night. It's quiet. Mm, it is quiet. Why don't you put on some music. - The chimes, Gunther. - Okay.  Gunther! I said chimes! - Gunther, no! - Aah, aah! Sorry, Master. I'll put him back. He-e-e-e-e-e-y. Mm. What? Aw, never mind. Here. Take the jar and find me some water. There's not enough moisture in the air for me to make us an ice camp. Uh, Master? I'm sorry I don't think I've seen any water at all today. Just do it. Don't anger daddy. Wait. Are you my father? No, but I stole your egg and mutated your brain. Get going. - Mm. -  Heh. - You don't know where you're going, do you, girl? -  -  -  Aw, you're good at this. Man, you know who I like? Master Evergreen. He could do anything! One thing he's gonna do he said he's gonna teach me magic. I can be like him! Ugh. -  - Nina, no! Aah! Master Evergreen. I found the water so you could build a oh. I guess he also found water, too.  He-e-e-e-e-e-y.  Now, Gunther, listen to me. Don't follow me into Magwood's lair, or else he'll melt your dome. Yeah. Oh, Gunther! You should see this! Okay. Gunther, no. You failed. He'll melt your dome.  Not as grand as you once were, eh? -  - Master Evergreen, I'm sorry, but I got worried. - Eeeeeeee! -  -  -  Ohh, boy. Um, maybe, maybe, maybe Maybe I can do magic like Master Evergreen. Buh-ice! Blah. Sorry. -  -  Shh! That's what you get. -  - Aaaaaaaaaahh! -  - Buh-ice! This is why I don't teach you magic. - Nina, Keena, Peena, Preena - Gunther! What the heck are you doing? Get in here! Gunther! Ah, there you are, you blockhead. Quickly, take your position. We have precious little time. Once I complete the bonding chant, you deactivate the force field. Bonding, bonding, three, two, one. You can do it, you can do it. Three, two, one. Bonding, bonding. - I did it. I -  -  - Oh. Aaaaaaaahh! Come on, now. What I ever do to you? Aah! - Watch the column, stupid! -  - Whoops! -  - Easy now. - Oh, wow. Did you see th ohh! Ow! My front bone! Gunther. Gunther, can you hear me?  Y yes, Master Evergreen. Okay, good. Now, aiming at the sound of my voice, throw the crown so it lands right on top of my head. I wait. What? No, no, there's no time. - It must be you, Gunther. - Me? Don't worry. It's easy. Even a mush-head like you couldn't donk it up too bad. Just focus on your deepest, truest wish the destruction of the deadly comet and the rest will take care of itself. My deepest, truest wish.  Gunther, no. - Gunther, no. - Gunther? Buddy? - What are you wishing for down there? - Gunther, no. Gunther, no. Gunther, no. Gunther, no. Gunther, no. Gunther, no. Gunther, no. Gunther, no. That that's the wrong wish. You've got to snap out of it! - Gunther, no! - Use a concentration spell or or a basic focusing charm like I taught you! I mean, like I meant to teach you. - I - Gunther, no! Gunther, no! - Gunther, no! Gunther, no! - Ice king: Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, nooooo! Mornin'. Man, what a dream. Uh, do you guys ever have that dino-boy dream, uh, with the asteroi what? What? What is it? Somethin' in my teeth? Something in my hair? Something in my nose? Something in my ear?


  Slam! "Hey, I was trying to read that!" "That book is above your level." "What business are you into?" "None of your business!" "Talk about it over lunch?" "Heh, if you're buying." - "Hey!" - "Hey!" "Fight!" Aah! It's terrible! Lumpy Space Princess?! What's wrong? You guys, somebody stole something from me something I can't live without!

LSP, who robbed you? Lt was Puh Pete Pete Sa Sass as Oh, uh I think I gave her too much. Jake, a crime has been committed. We must find the criminal - We must. and retrieve whatever it is that was stolen from Lumpy Space Princess! Stolen. But all we have to go on is part of a name Pete something. Need more clues! Hold me! Clues, clues, clues What's that? I can't see it. Oop. Sorry. Ahh. There's something in her hand! A key! A key to what? "3-0-3." Hmm. Ooh! Turn it around. Ah! Looks like we got our first lead. Unh! Hmm. Found anything yet, Jake? I got some bags and Wait! More bags. But no leads on Pete something. Same here. Beemo, start marking evidence. Hmm. Hmm. Hmmm. Dude, check this. Is this blood? Yeah, man, that's definitely blood. Hmm. LSP's injuries were So it has to belong to Pete Sa-something. Beemo, take a sample and do a full blood analysis. The "woiks." Hey, if that guy cut himself during the robbery, he might have gone somewhere to buy a mini adhesive bandage. There's a drug store across the street. Let's roll! Whoa! Vroom! And if the oozing persists, just come back and I'll give you something a little stronger. I'm Finn. This is my partner Jake. Hello, citizen, had anyone in here looking to buy some mini adhesive bandages today? A lot of people come through my store, gentlemen. You can't seriously think I'd be able to remember any one particular customer among the countless others I see on a daily basis now, can you? I guess not. Fair do's. Come on, Jake Wait! Now that you mention it, there was this one guy in here earlier. Real suspicious type. Had a nose bleed. Said it was the first one he'd had in years. Used to get them all the time as a kid, he said. Could never remember if he was supposed to pinch his nose and hold his head back or pinch his nose and hold his head forward. Maybe it was a case of being boxed on the nose too many times made the blood vessels in his lower septum weak and vulnerable to hemorrhaging. Anyway, his mammy always said it was because he couldn't keep those picky little fingers out of his dirty little nose holes. He didn't buy it, though. He always thought Ma'am, can you give us a name? Mmmmm, nope. No, wait. Yes, I can. Pete Sassafrass. Pete Sa Sass as Did you catch which way he was going? Of course. He said he was catching a train at 11:27, Candy Kingdom station, Platform 5. Heh. I'm sorry. I wish I could remember more. See anyone who might be our guy? Nope. Nobody suspicious here. Just a load of decent, law-abiding folk. What the Jake, what's with all the turning into stuff today? I really like turning into cop stuff. I literally can't stop turning into cop stuff. Final boarding Hey, there's Platform 5. service to Peppermint Hills, Track 5. I see a nasty "tranch"! Let's book 'im, son. Hup! Sorry! Whoa! Comin' through! Hup! Stop right there! What's under that skeezy trench coat, you Crook! Busted! For attempting to board a train without a ticket. Aw, guys, he's getting away! We're not criminals, man! We're working the beat, just like you! Jimmy? Yep, checks out. He tastes like police. Eh, sorry about that, officers. It was an honest mistake. Ugh! We lost him. Not yet we didn't. Unh! Too far ahead. We'll never catch it! If we cut through the forest, maybe we can head it off at the pass. Sweet thinking! Oh, deer! Yeah! Are you Pete Sassafrass? Wha? I got a lot of names. Who's askin'? Give back what you stole from LSP! Who? What's that? An acronym or somethin'? Oof! Cuff him. All right, I got this. Oof! You have the right to remain Busted. All right, you listen, flatfoot. There's been some kind of crazy mistake here. I didn't do nothin'! Save it for the Candy Judge, Pete. Look, you can drop the act and cut the sass, Sassafrass. We've got an eyewitness and your blood at the scene of the crime. You do the crime, you do the time, man. Roll the dice, you pay the price. What dice? Oh, you guys are donkers. Burgle our friend, it's the end for yo-o-o-o-o-u. I want to see a lawyer. I'll handle this, Pete. You're upsetting my client. Just look at that face. That constitutes harassment, so give him some space. Don't worry, buddy. I've got this case. "Welcome to the next 25 years of your life!" We deserve doughnuts. Let's bowl. No, no, wait, please. You guys! "Guilty!" Man, we didn't just crack that case We crunched it. Crumbled it. We are awesome at being cops. There's no question about that. Ah, call me crazy, but I was thinking maybe we should actually become detectives, like as a job! When we were out on the streets back there, getting those leads, busting that perp, it just felt so I don't know right. I know, man. I actually totally do know exactly what you mean. Ah. Dude. I told you, I have a problem. I can't stop. Howdy, partner. Oh, hey, Beemo. What's going on? I've finished processing the blood sample, and I have the results. - Nice. - Yeah, good work, Beemo. It's Pete Sassafrass's blood, right? No, it doesn't belong to anyone because it's not blood. It's tomato sauce. Tomato sauce? Hmm. Pete Sa Sass as Pete sa Oh, my mind! LSP wasn't trying to say "Pete Sa-something." She was trying to say "pizza" something! But how would pizza sauce end up in a hotel room? Unless it was delivered. Pizza Sassy's! Where is the delivery guy?! Oh, you mean Petey. He's out. He's making deliveries. Or maybe he's out tying up loose ends. LSP could be in dange-r-r-r-r! Dange-r-r-r-r! - Phone? - Phone. Princess! Add some banana guards outside of LSP's hospital room. Huh? Why? LSP could be in danger! LSP woke up and went back to her hotel room. Oh, my J-i-i-i-i-im! He's already here! Can I help you? LSP! Ow! Ow! Hey! Hey, no! Oh, no! What are you doing?! It was you. - You did it! - Help me! I was just delivering the pizza she ordered, and now she won't let me leave. LSP, what is going on? You said he stole something from you. Well, he did! He stole my heart! Hurry up, dude! - Shh! - Right. Hoo! Thanks! - Shh! - Go! Go! No tip, huh? That's great. That's how it is around here. Fine. Huh? Huh? Come on, pal. Turns out the only case here is just another case of LSP being nutty.    - This party is so crazy!


(Mouse squeaks) (Penguins wenk) (All cheering) (Screeches)  SubRip by fant0m BREAKFAST PRINCESS: (Clears throat) We are delighted to host this year's Princess Day here in Breakfast Kingdom. Please enjoy the continental breakfast expertly prepared by our very own breakfast chefs. Now on to more pressing matters. Brigands have been attacking our Western seaports, dozens of unregistered Princesses roam the land, and trade deficits are at an all-time high! Historically, Breakfast Kingdom has traded one sack of sugar a month to Slime Kingdom in exchange for four eggs, but egg production has plummeted! I can't just pop out eggs on command. I'm an artisan! You have an egg in you right now. (Gasps) How dare you? Yeah, and what about that peanut juice, Peanut Princess? My body needs juice! I'm not giving out a single drop of nut butter, not until Raggedy Princess pays me! Fine! Take it! Take all my socks! You still owe me a pair of jorts! PRINCESS: And, hey, what about my tuque?! (Groaning) (Indistinct arguing) Aaah! (Arguing stops) You guys, I'm bored out of my face! I make a motion to stop talking about dumb stuff that's lame! Oh, Lumpy Space Princess, I'm afraid you'll have to be patient with us and our petty disputes. Not all of us have achieved the self-sufficiency that I assume you have in your kingdom. (Gasps) Oh, wait. That's right. You don't have a kingdom! You live in a box in the woods. It's not a box. It's a rotting log. (Scoffs) Sorry, LSP, but the chair only recognizes real Princesses, not bums. What?! I'm like a cool hippie. Whatever, freeloader. If you were invited to Princess Day, it must have been a mistake or as a joke. Am I right, girls? Ohh! The joke's on you because I wasn't invited. I'm crashing! And I already ate a bunch of your food! What you gonna do about it, Princess egg breath? ALL: Ooh! (Groans) That's true. She does have egg breath. Okay, you've wasted enough of our time. Guards, take this pamplemousse out of my sight. (Gasps) You didn't! Don't touch me! (Gobble!) (Gulp!) (Indistinct conversations) Hmm. Okay. Now that the wannabe's gone, let's get back to Princess Business. O-oh, no, not you, Princess Business. Uh, Princess Business. No. Sounds the same. I'm sorry. Hey, you want to ditch this jazz? I'd love to, but I'm really invested in this crossword puzzle. Figs. Hmm. LSP, wait up! Whoa. (Muttering) Lousy Breakfast Princess. Pamplemousse. What is that, even? Yo, LSP. Sick tag. Oh. Thanks? You know, I like your vibe, dude. You don't take anyone's sass. Yeah, especially not from that gross pile of greasy hash! She lumpin' humiliated me! MARCELINE: Listen, let's get even. Teach old greasy locks a lesson. (Laughs) You're bad. And I like it. This place is huge!  This place smells like butter, bacon, sausage, and juice Gonna mess with Breakfast Princess 'cause she called me pamplemousse  "Yobo, peebocheeks. Just kicking down the town with LSP-boos. She is acting sooo bad." "Ha. Just don't let her get out of control." "Too late. LSP is really doing it up right now, and I'm just feeding the flames." "Nooooo," exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point! Look. There. Breakfast Princess' room. How you want to get past the maple man? I'll show you, hon. Ooh! Ahh! Hey, there. Yeah, look over here. What? (Groans) Nice distraction. BOTH: Right on. Blah! Ugh. I can't digest syrup. (Grunting) That's for poisoning my girl! Stop! Okay, just one more time. (Grunting) I thought you were bad. Bad people don't stop. Let's don't stop inside. BOTH: P-p-p-payback! Uh all her clothes are sticky. And her taste in music is terrible. (Laughs) Check it out. I hate this album, but I'm taking it anyway. (Laughs) (Laughs) That's messed up! (Gobble!) (Garbled) This'll teach Breakfast Princess. Huh?! Jerry! Who did this to you, Jerry?! I don't know, but they got past me. (Door creaking) (Gasps) We're busted. Turn invisible! I can't. Well, hide, then! Uh hide where? I know somebody's in here. I heard someone say "Where." Getting close now. No sign of the intrud er. Aaah! My eyes! (Laughs) Ohhh. (Thud) (Moaning) Oh, it smells like grapefruit. BOTH: Yeah! (Grunting) (Both laugh) When I recover my sight, I'm going to imprison you, you giggling girls! Aah! (Growls) (Both breathing heavily) I got this. (Breathing heavily) I don't see them. BOTH: Hey. (Gasps) (Shrieking) Waaaah! (Thud) Oh, glob. (Moaning) BOTH: He's okay! Other Jerry, what happened? BOTH: Yeah! Okay, let's take a lunch break, everybody. Oh, when I say lunch, I, of course, mean breakfast. Your Highness. There are vandals ruining the castle. They are bad. Okay. I'll handle it. Fellow Princesses, I got to deal with matters of state. My little sister, Strudel Princess, will take over for me. (Clears throat) Eat the berries! Dip them in the syrup. Rup, rup! Want me to show you how? LSP: (Grunting) (Engine turns over) BOTH: Whoo! (Tires squeal) A squirrel taught me how to do that. That's awesome. Stop right the (thud!) (Tires screech) What was that?! Oh, glob. Oh, glob. Oh, glob, oh, glob, oh, glob! Everyone will know it was me! I can't go to jail! I'm too pretty! (Cries) Oh, I'm sorry, mom and daddy! Aah! Hey! Calm your lumps. (Whimpers) (Moans) It's okay! She's just dazed. I'll handle it. Come on. (Engine turns over) (CD player whirs) (Mid-tempo music plays) (Sighs) It'll be fine, dude. Girls like us just got to stick together. Breakfast Princess, you should pay attention when somebody cool is trying to talk. LSP, is that you? Oh. Glob, no. Not even. (Scoffs) What's this for? For digging. Now start building a-a sand castle. (Engine turns over) Don't stop digging or we'll know! BOTH: Whoo! Yeah! (Chuckles) That was totally fun being bad with you, Marcy. (Chuckling) Yeah, that was pretty rad. Do you think, like, doing all that bad stuff makes us like, bad people? Uh probably not. I don't think there are bad people. Hmm. I think good people do bad stuff sometimes, and oh and that's bad. But if you only do it once, it's just a mistake, and that's not bad. I think. (Laughs) Word. But I mean (sighs) I do think it was wrong to steal this CD. Yeah, I feel kind of bad about that. (CD player whirs) We should probably mail it back to her. Yeah! Good call. I Oh, my glob! Aaah! Aaah! Aah-aah! BOTH: Pow! Couldn't get up from the bed. I was lazy, and that's why I can't have frosting anymore. Okay, so does everybody have what they want? (Cheers and applause) Wait, I think I'm ready to pop it. (Grunting) Ha! (Cheers and applause) Happy Princess Day!    


  Remember last time we were out this way? It was right after you messed things all up with flame princess. Yeah, that sucked. But then we found the dungeon train, remember? That was awesome. No. It wasn't. Sure it was. Anyway, flambo's brother's map says the weird cave should be, like, right over Ah! It's right here. Come on, Jake. Okay, hold on, let me get out my sidewalk chalk. I want to write all over the walls in there. What? You can't use that stuff in here. This is like an ancient, sacred temple. Oh, well, now, that's just great. You don't put traps in the foyer! The foyer is a safe space. Man, not even Jake could smash through this mess. But maybe there's a back door or something. Uh-oh options. Better leave a little trail in case I get lost Bread-crumb style. Plus, for if Jake gets in and tries to track me down. Too bad I don't still have that sidewalk chaaaaahhhhhh oof! Okay, well, scratch that. Now I really hope there's another way out. Hall of Egress. Egress. Egress. What's "Egress" mean? "Exit." Egress means exit! Okay. Yaaaaaaah! Great. What am I supposed to do now? Wait. Hey. Hey, I just smashed you. I Ahh. Magic door. Okay. Right. But if I Ahh? Well done, Finn. You solved the magic door. That ought to have done it. And Oh. I guess this door's just too tricky for me. Guess I better give up, right? Wrong. Wrong! Let's try that again. Hmm. It's smooth like metal. Floor's smooth too. Oh! What have we here? An errant thread! It must lead back out Bread crumb sty Oof! Trap door? Yow! Spike trap. Better head back and regroup. Fiendish. Anyway Don't let's do that again. And right Then straight And Hey now. Hold the phone. There should be a left turn here. Letters? "E" "G" Egress! It spells "Egress!" This way! And here's another one. And another. Wah! Ow! Okay, so Every map I make is wrong. All the exit signs led to traps. Plus the braille, the hieroglyphics, and the tape recorder message too. It's almost like the maze is trying to tell me something. Something confusing. Whatever! Who needs you anyway, with your stupid signs and messages? I'm Finn Mertens, ya heard? And I don't need no nothing! Watch me. Babababababababababababababa Ba ba ba ba ba ba Finn? Finn! Jake! Jake, I'm coming! Finn? Where are ya, buddy? Jake! That's a little disappointing. Still, though. I'm in the homestretch here. Jake! Finn! Hey, there you are. Yeah. Sorry to pop up, then disappear again like that. Again? You just got here, son. I did? Shoot, man. This cave has got me straight scrambled up and down. What cave? What? Oh. Uh-oh. Well? Well, I followed your map, but there's just a bunch of grass here. What?! Let me see! Dang it. So, yeah. Everything I did to try to make sense of the maze or to play it safe totally backfired. But when I got fed up, and started just charging in Willy-nilly, I was able to get to the end and find you. And then the whole thing disappeared. But I wonder how come I don't remember any of it. I don't know. I'm just hoping, maybe if I sleep it off, maybe I'll be better in the morning. Okay, well Good night, buddy. Thanks, Jake. Good night. Are you awake? Yes. Are you gonna open your eyes now? Maybe. Are you scared? No. Then do it. On three. - One - One - Two - Two Three! So Been almost a month now. What do ya think? You wanna try opening 'em? It's a beautiful day. Plus, I need someone to tell me if this hat looks cool. Man, I told you If I open 'em now it'll just be the same. I got to wait till something's different. Yeah. That makes sense, I guess. So, um, I got you a little something. A little present. Wow, thanks, man! You're really gonna thank me. Gotcha! Nooo! Yeah, you've done it, like, 30 times now. Yaahh! Yaahh! Yaahh! Yaahh! It's like programmed into your DNA or something. Well, shoot, man. If I wanna do it that bad, it must be kinda right, right? Look at it from where I'm sitting. All this funky pizzazz that only you can see That's like the literal definition of a hallucination. Either all that stuff is a dream, or like, I'm a dream And I ain't no dream, ya heard? Yeah, I know. I heard. It's just that, well Hyah! Open up! Oh, Jake. I know you mean well, but I guess I got to see this one through on my own. I'll see you around, buddy. Huh? Huh? What the? How long has this been going on? Someone's apt to track me down Bread-crumb style. E.G. Jake. Can't let him catch me. No more threads to follow. No more Egress. Mm. It's cool in here. Ain't nothing wrong with that. Deep too. That's good. Ain't nobody gonna be looking for me down Ugh! Wah! Egress! Egress! Egress! Egress! Eeg Something's different. Hurry, Finn. At the Seashell's Center lies the Cornucopia's smallest door. Whoa! That must have been some cave! No comment!


Time, sweet time Don't slip away from me Love It flows like a garden hose Rise, you rose Love out of time Face me your face Put your love in its place In my face In my face In my face  Wait, I was hunting a vampire, The Moon Cut it out! That's not helping her! But Mom and Dad always burped on us. It's a cure-all! Sorry, guys, there are no cure-alls. Your parents were just burping on you for kicks. Oh, yeah, that makes sense. Oh, sorry, last one. What did you eat, Jake?! Hey, now! I pride myself in having nice-smelling burps. Just kidding. Pride, hmm. Do you guys know what "hubris" is? It's like an old-timey deity who weighed your deeds on a scale. No, it means excessive pride or arrogance. That's like you, P.B. Dude. No, it's true. I believed in myself so much that I was blind to the possible consequences. Don't believe in yourself so much, then, dum dum. Now my best friend is dying of poison because of me. That ain't true, P.B. Marci took a risk. And you helped her because you're her friend. Real friends take each other to the edge of death 'Cause death is life! Right, Finn? Shoot, yeah! I get poisoned all the time just doing the dishes! I get poisoned on porpose For research. I have a poison lab back at the castle. Well, let's get our butts over there, then! Find The Moon, Finn. We'll work on an antidote. You guys take her back to the poison lab. Maybe we can extract her healing powers. Word! Hey, wait! What should I do? You guys? Moon pearls - We're on her trail. - Gross! I think they're pretty. What if they're, like, her boogers or worse? Come on, Jake. Ew, ew, ew, ew! Sometimes I think vampires were invented just to torment me. Whoa. I don't think so, man. I think you might have a hubris. I'm just saying it's a possibility. Hey, look! The Moon's pontoon. See?! I hate it! What is this, some hut The Moon plopped out of her bod? I don't think so. This mummy job looks like it used to belong to that mummy job. Still hate it. What's that, pickles? Ew. Yeah, that's her. Shouldn't she, like, explode or something? She just healed that sword right out of her bod! Let's try frying her up in the sun. - Wow! - Wow! How are we supposed to destroy this stay-fresh creep? Hmm. Let's stick with P.B.'s plan and try staking her a bunch of different ways. Hmm Higher Higher. Lower. Up Lower Perfect. - Whoa! - Hey! Ah! What are you doing here, former Princess Bubblegum? Did you forget that you lost the election? Monarchies are not democracies! What?! Oof! Aah! - Ooh - Ooh Hey! Banana Guards, seize her! Uh, princess, should we listen to him? No, just keep him out of my way! And untie Crunchy! Thank you, Your Princessness! Man, we've been doing this for hours. You know, it's weird that P.B. wanted us to stake her back, instead of us taking her back. Wait. "Taking" or "staking"? She said "you guys, 'sztake' her back." No, yeah! She said, "you guys, take her back." So which one should we do? Both, I guess. We'd better hurry before she wakes up at sundown. Whoops. Get her back in the vase! Come get us, blood bucket! What?! Run! Here she come! Dude, for real, why'd you make her chase us? Marci needs her healing powers. "Stake her back" to the castle, bro! Shoot, just don't let her near my deli tray! Well, run harder, dude! Okay. Man, she is really booking it hard! You see that, Jake? No, bro, just let me run! Holy stink! She's smiling right at me! I don't need a play-by-play, man! - She's messing with us. - What do you mean?! I mean she's not catching up on purpose! Why do you think that? She's giving me this look Slow down so I can talk to her. No, boy, you crazy! Just do it! I won't let her bite you! Okay, my life is in your hands, man! Hey. We're leading you to a trap. We're gonna suck out your healing power and dust you. And then I'm gonna put your dust in a litter box. And get a tiger to drop a huge smelly tiger bomb on your sorry dust clumps! Stop hitting my butt! You run in the path of my light. That's her voice?! How can you lead me when I am your guide? Are you being literal or allegorical? Me no like! Run, Jake, run! But she said I'm running in her light! Who gives a donk?! Just go! All right, where's your measuring equipment? I need to see some charts! And tubes Where are your tubes? This process uses no tubes and involves no quantifiable measurements. Calm your mind and let the crystal medium work its magi Its science. All right, Pep. I just wish I could do more for her. There, there. We're all worried about Marceline. That's not really why I'm crying. Princess, we really miss you! Come on, guys, it's all right. Oh! Shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh. - Okay, finished. - That's it? You just go, "shu, shu, shu" with your hands? Don't question my methods! This is my world. Okay, what now, then? We wait, like, two hours. Oh. Let's do something else. Like what? Mm, video games? I don't like video games. Me neither. I don't even have a system to play on or anything. I got a video game back at my place. But I just got it so I could stay in shape. How do you get in shape playing a game? Uh It's like a yoga video. So it's not a game at all. No, it is. It's a video game. Uh, it's a video. Yes. A yoga video. Game. - A game. - Video. You guys. We brought The Moon! What do we do? Die like pigs! Hold her off till Marci wakes up! She's not doing anything. You gonna try something? Okay, I guess. - Whoops! - What was that?! I don't know, man, I think I just got tapped out! "Tap out"? When do you ever tap out? Pigs! She's doing something weird! Jake, help! I can't! I feel like I'm in a slow-motion terror dream! Banana Guards, help! Princess, I can't stop her! You kind of have to, Finn! Rats! Okay, let me get my sword. Marceline. It's locked, dipstick! Open, pig! Open, pig! Pigs! Come on, Marci, wake up! Wake up!  It's spring again And the yard is full Of tiny flowers You used to call them weeds And you killed them all But they were growing too tall  What?! I can't hear you! I said, "Wake up, Marceline." What?! Wake u Huh? Pigs! Pigs! You! Marceline! Pigs, pigs! Did you just yell "pigs" at the lock until it opened? Oh! Oh! In your face! Marci, now! Finn. Yes! Finn, she's dead. Oh, thank glob.


    Oh, hello! Ha ha! Here for more graybles, I presume? Well, you've come to the right computer-fable. Feast your eyes-mabel on my holo-pyramid viewer and huh? What's that? Not in the mood for graybles, you say? Oh, dear. Are you okay? Did something fatlabel happen to you? Oh, I see. You'd rather watch me buh-blabel a birdhouse together in my workshop. Hmm. More of a grayble man by trade. But okay! Come on!  Oh, hello again. As you can see, the birdhouse is nearly complete. All that's left is a "where the door hole goes," but I can't remember. Hmm. Door hole Wait! I just remembered. My door-hole solution lies in one of tonight's scheduled graybles! Would you mind if I look through them to find it? Okay! Ha ha! Whee! Here we go.  Hey, Jake, Jr. You havin' fun at daddy's? Hmm? Oh. Sure, dad. Okay. You seem kind of dump trucks. What? Heh. You know, "in the dumps." Oh, sorry. It's cool. I'm just thinking about the future, I guess. We're on, like, the bleeding edge of history. Everything ahead of us is totally unknown, and there's no guarantee that things are going to be all right. It's exciting, but it's also pretty scary. You know? Heh heh heh. Sounds like my little baby girl want to build a time machine! Oooooooooh! - Guys, I don't - No, no, no. Leave it up to your daddy and Uncle Finn. Hup! Okay. You guys have fun. I'm gonna get some more juice. Mom has some weird taste in men. FINN: Psst! She's comin' back! Ding-ding! Skreeee! Hello-o-o-o-o? Ooh! Is that the-time machine part that I ordered? Mm-hmm! You just got to sign for it to prove you accepted delivery. Ac-cept-tance. Guys, I'm basically 30. I'm not a little kid anymore. You're not a little kid anymore!  Cinnamon Bun, you can't sleep with a night light anymore. You're basically 30. It's starting to bum everyone out. I can't handle this denial of li-i-i-i-i-ght! Yeah, well  Nooooooooooooooooo! Too dark! No! It's too bright!  Now it's too dark! Oh. Okay. This is nice. Wee-oo, wee-oo, wee-oo! CINNAMON BUN: Aah! Too dark! Hey, Cinnabun! I need soft light! Yeeaargh! Yeeaargh! How long has this been in here? Don't even remember buying this. Oh, well. Easy come, easy go.  Goodbye. Well, that wasn't so bad.  Hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Nothing like a hard day's work to get them spirits a-lifted!  Great news, fellas I finished all my chores, so we can start movie night early. Take your seats, and I will review the nominees. We've got "Baby Ballet," "Blimby: Who Gots Da ABC's," "Airplanes Taking Off'  Oh, wait! What's this one? "Basic Mortality: Season 1"? Isn't this that show that everyone's talking about? I heard that this show is, like, really good for penguins. Wow. That's really lucky for you guys. I'm a little jealous. Well, anyway, good luck to all our nominees. Okay! All in favor of "Blimby: Who Gots Da ABC's," raise your hands. Okay! All in favor of "Baby Ballet," raise your hands. Okay! All in favor of "Airpl" What?! "Baby Ballet"?! Come on! Ugh! I never should've given you penguins the right to vote. Well, you may have numbers on your side, but I've still got one trick up my sleeve bargaining! Whereby, you let me watch "Basic Mortality," and I, in return, will do anything you want in the whole world. How about it?  Ha ha! Algebraic!  Look, I know he was your partner. Enough! Alan is not the super-murderer! I don't know about this show though. This, Captain, is the most lamentable super-murder I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty. Might be a touch too dark. Too dark! Too bright! Eat on it! Hmm! Hmm. Oh, little lemonsweets, our son so precious. You've enjoyed sitting in your chair? What would you like to do now? "Go to bed." - No, he wants to dance! - Ehn! Dearest brother, I really think Lemonsweets would rather go to bed!  Mnh! Hunh! I'll fetch our son a sleeping bonnet. Beautiful.  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Brother, stop that!! We hate you. Aaaaaaaah! Only o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne!!  The end! My end! My end table. My love seat, yeah. Gee, but it's great to be back home. It's always a blast visiting my cousin, City Fox, at his future palace. But you just can't beat that old country steez. City Fox's digs be mad sterile. Look at this. This was my grandpa's rug. Some bums let him have it 'cause it was so ugly.  And check out these classic stylings! They don't make 'em like this anymore! Whoa! Ha ha ha! Almost got me right in my both eyes! Look at my bugs. Man, I always did have the ugliest bugs.  What are they doing? Selling each other houses? Yes, sirree, there's some things money can't buy. You see that depression? You can't buy that. You gotta earn it. Boy, it's like I can almost see myself sleeping in there Yah! Wh-What? "Dear conscious self I know where some buried treasure is. I'll draw you a map. Love, subconscious self." Oh, my gosh! I'm gonna be rich! Ha ha!  What the - Whoop! Oh, no! My riches!  Let me in! It's too bright!  Too dark! Aaaaaaaaaah! Cinnamon Bun! You did a great job on this wall. It's very rustic.  Mmm what a jerk. What? A jerk? Yeah, just give it a little jerk. Now that's a time machine. Hey, sweetie! Sweetie, look your time machine's all ready. Oh, yeah. You having fun, dad? Aw, anything for my baby pup. Okay. As long as you're having fun.  Time machine! Shpiow! Ha ha! There it is. You see? The birdhouse door it's right above the peg thingy. Why didn't I think of that? Ha ha! Well, I guess that's it for this week. I'll see you crimpy glimmers on the What? What's that? You want to finish the grayble? You want to see if you can still guess the theme? You just want to see how it ends. Well, let's get right to it then. Ha ha! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Shh-shh-shh! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Strang Excuse me. Hey! Why're you trying to steal my dad's stuff?! Hey! I need a night light because I'm so scared! Man, you can't steal, dummy.  Fine!  Here. Now get lost! Ye-e-e-e-s! Take that, Princess Bubblegum! Jake Jr., I'm sorry for messing up your time travel. Ah, that's okay. It was just make-believe anyways. FINN: Oh. Was it? Then how do you explain tomorrow's newspaper?    


1  Hmm. Let's see what else the cards say.  This card means you're a man.  Okay.  (LAUGHS) No, I'm kidding.  It means you're nice.  I'm learning truth about myself.  (LAUGHS)  Hey, Dad, what if I called you "Papa"?  "I love the sea, Papa!"  How are your card fingers feeling?  That's a weird thing to say, Papa.  Have you seen cards like this?!  What?  No! Not today!  No Card Wars!  (SPLASH)  She sunk like a stone!  (GROANS)  Ah, there's no time to go back!  The tourney starts in an hour!  BMO is always fine.  I don't understand.  Card Wars the great and venerable game of old.  It is the king and queen of tabletop games.  It combines the mechanics of simulated combat,  hand management,  commodity speculation,  worker placement,  blind auctioning,  and set collection.  Battle happens in one of four combat lanes,  each deriving its power from one of the 16 themed elements  Corn, wheat, blue, crystals,  (WAVES ROARING) acumen, torpor, frozen lakes, lizard holes, learning  (WAVES RUMBLING)  (YAWNS LOUDLY)  That's too many rules.  I don't do cards to follow rules.  But you could be so good!  Daddy's pro-tege!  Of course I'd be good at it, but I'm not into it.  Look, I lost track of how old I am.  Maybe I'm almost 40. I don't know.  I at least need to unpack my last decade  before embarking on my next decade.  I've got to win and be dignified.  20s are for regretting, 30s are for being dignified,  and 40s are older than I ever want to be.  Hmm.  O kay.  You give me one of your  bones  and I'll play one of your games.  (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES) (GROANS)  I activate the Barrel.  I floop the Cooper.  - Mmmwah! - Mmmwah!  Cute!  Welcome, Charlie, to the 59th Card Wars Doubles Classic!  That's Todd and Jennings signing in.  And over there, Benton and Mike R.  Luke and Captain Majesty.  Mr. Outrageous and Mr. International.  Who's that, Papa?  That's uh the reigning champs.  Jake?  (WAVES BUILD)  Grand Prix.  Man, I thought you swore off tourney play  Like, angrily swore it off.  (CLEARS THROAT)  Oh. Uh, pardon.  Hello, Jake.  Is that you, Moniker?  How are you?  - We've been just grea - Her?  Oh, this is my daughter/ Card Wars partner, Charlie!  'Sup?  That's fantastic, Jake.  You always wanted kids.  Well, she's a chip off the old block, I'll bet.  Us, we're running the local after-school C.W. program  Just like where you and me first met.  (WAVES RUMBLING)  Most days, we're busy running the screen-printing shop,  but, uh, we still make time for the tourney  - (RUMBLING FADES) - just for fun, you know.  Yes! We're all here to have fun!  Well, got to sign in.  Come, Charlie!  Nice meeting you.  That's your ex, huh?  What?  Nothing.  You've definitely got a type.  (LAUGHS)  ANNOUNCER: Round 1!  Jake and Charlie A.K.A. Team Dignified  Versus Reggie and Pete the punk.  Ohhhh! Blah, blah, blah!  Commence Card Wars!  I floop the Hay Barn, and I attack with Feed Man!  ANNOUNCER: A solid move from the veteran Jake.  I cast Bean Ball Bomba.  Bean Ball!  Bean Ball?!  Feed Man's power source is gone!  No, no, no!  No big deal.  (INHALES SHARPLY)  Your turn, sweetie.  Okay.  I'll play  this one.  (BEEP)  (CHUCKLES) "Floop."  (WHIRRRRR!)  Granary Weevil on your first draw?!  Unprecedented.  And combined with a downed Feed Man,  that means  ANNOUNCER: He's right It's Infinite Haymaker!  That's game!  A stunning move from the newcomer Charlie.  She's a real pro-tege.  We win!  Whoo! (LAUGHS) (LAUGHING)  Yeah, I'm out.  What?!  One bone, one game.  But I'm not done burying my 20s.  Do you want more bones? Is that it?!  Nah. I only need one.  Catch ya on the flip, Papa.  (SQUISH!)  (RATTLE!)  Announcer: Round 2 starts in five minutes.  Still dignified.  Psst.  Lost your partner, huh?  Hey, don't worry we won't tattle.  (TING!)  I will crush you, Grand Prix.  (WIND WHISTLING)  I'm home!  Hey, you two been kissing?  What-what?!  (CREAK!)  Me hungy.  Gomp!  All y'all keep quiet! Charlie's flexin'!  Let's see.  Finally, I've got the hair of the mother  and a bone of the father.  Time to do a rare turbo-boosted personal reading.  Self-care mega-blow.  Announcer: It's the semi-final round,  and Mr. Outrageous has Jake on the ropes.  JAKE: (THINKING) I can still play my Ultra Dog and force a draw.  And while technically a legal move,  it's considered a low-class maneuver  this late in the tourney.  (GROANS)  Jake.  Do it!  I play Ultra Dog!  Announcer: A shocking move!  Ultra Dog attacks the Tilled Field with "Cold Nose"!  Which means cat's game!  But by tourney rules,  the slight point lead gives the win to Team Dignified!  They advance to the finals versus Grand Prix and Moniker.  Just a garbage, garbage win.  (CHUCKLES EVILLY)  (GASPS) What am I doing?!  (WAVES RUMBLING)  (CARDS SHUFFLE)  All right. The deck is ripe.  Let's see what the cards say.  Dad! Why are you here?  This one's about me!  (GROANING)  That's too much sandwich! You got to chew!  Gah!  Is this my 20s?  Dad was right.  I've got to fix these "faults of youth."  My 30s?  I look lost.  My 40s.  I'm afraid.  Also, I'm naming you "Gibbon."  My 50s.  Midlife crisis.  Good luck, Gibbon!  My 60s.  I'm unfamiliar with my changing body.  My 70s.  I begin to lose people around me.  My 80s.  I'm afraid again.  My 90s.  I'm content and wise!  Yeah!  Wrinkles!  Oh, no!  I've been a total wand to my dad!  I've got to go help him!  Come on, Jakey. pull it together.  Blah! Win! Win at all costs!  No! I bury you!  Feel your 20s!  No, no, no!  CHARLIE: Be cool.  Mom?  No, Papa. It's your 90-year-old daughter.  You flake!  Be content.  (SCREAMS)  Whoa!  Whoo! Whoo!  Whoop! Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!  (BOTH WHOOPING)  Ka-pow!  Whoop! Yeah!  Whoop! What-what?!  Dignified!  Yeah!  Winners Grand Prix and Moniker Des Louise.  (WAVES RUMBLING)  (RUMBLING FADES)  Good game, Grand Prix, Moniker.   (CHUCKLES) Okay.

Okay, guys. The first phase of vampire orientation is learning Invisibility! Ah, hey! You ready for the power of - Invisibility? - With all my heart! Good. Now, spin! Give it a whirl, Jake! Now chant, "invisible! Invisible!" Invisible! Invisible! Oof! Yep. It worked. - We're invisible! - Ugh! - You're invisible! - Hey, then how come we can see each other? Because you guys became vampires at the same time, so you're forever linked. Aw, yeah! Marceline You're friends with some real morons. Oh, my God, Melissa. Ever since Clara stopped eating meat, her skin looks so good! I mean, she still looks fat, but, like, I can't say that junk to her face. Wow! Lsp's a hobo! Let's mess with her. I'm doing so awesome on my own. Like, right now, I found this - can of beans. Who-o-o-o-o-o-! Finn? Jake! Put down my stuff! She knows it's us! She must recognize our voices! Let's disguise them!

Stop the toughness lesson! W-what? - Finn, Jake, you guys okay? We're okay. It's all worth it. See? They're fine. When did you go all soft? You used to like teaching people about kicks. Hey, guys. I think you're ready to learn how to float. All you have to do is jump off that ledge. Cool. W-wait! There's more beginner lessons you need to learn before floating! Like, uh, the spooky vampire walk! See? Spo-o-o-o-o-o-oky! Whoo! No, way! We want to fly! You guys, stop right now! Marceline, chill out. It's going to be okay. We've got a plan. Now, get in your flying positions. Vampires forever! Whoo! What are you guys waiting for? Y-you said you had a plan. We do. It's to let them die. Wee-wha-whoo! - Oh, yeah! Oof! Whoo! Awesome! We did it! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Awesome! Way to go, marceline. Hey, you guys need to stop trying to kill my friends! They got to die someday. Hey! Let's invite them to our place. When they show up We'll suck their guts out through their brains! Did you see us?! Yeah, you guys were pretty amazing. Hey, we're gonna throw a party In honor of your new vampire skills. Holy snaps! That's awesome! They're lying to you guys. They just want to suck the guts - out of the top of your head. - What?! She's just jealous of you. We'll see you at midnight at our place. Guys, promise me you're not - going to that party. - We're not gonna go. - You're not? - Nah. I'm kind of tired from doing vampire stuff all day. We're just gonna chill. Oh. Okay. Well, we're going back home. - Peace. - Number 25 blood drive. Hey, guys! We're here! Wow! Look at you guys! That's awesome! Um Hyah! Georgy, what's wrong?! - Jake, what's happening?! - I think they're testing - our vampire ability! - Oh, sweet. Vampire kick! Ugh! Aw, come on! Will you knock it off already? You know you're not even real - vampires. - Psh! Then why am I flying, Wendy? Oh. Whoa! Yo, man. - I think marceline tricked us. - Yeah. Vampire kick! Finn, Jake I'm so sorry I got you into this. I should have never pranked you - so perfectly. - It's okay. You're here now to beat up those ghosts and save us. Oh, no, vampires can't beat ghosts. It's like a rock-paper-scissors thing. - I just came to apologize. - Aw, man! I can't believe we're gonna die just 'cause we wanted to be comfortable watching "heat signature." Uh, did you guys say "Heat signature"? Have you located the enemy's heat signature, private? Yes, sir. But I also noticed something Strange, something I-I -- I can't explain. Well, spit it out, man! I-I I can't seem to locate our heat signature! - Oh! This stinkups mega bam-bam to the j-stop! Can we just go back to the brain eating, or whatever? Mm-hmm, after the movie. - But can't we just -- Shh! Shut! Look out, commander! Aah! My heat signature!


    Man, let's go home. Nuts to that. I want to find a mystery cave.  But, Finn, I'm getting all cranky around my joke-hole. Oof! Ow! Ooh la-la! What's that? Mystery cave! Come on, Jake!  Oh, my glory. JAKE: Dude, no! Don't touch that thing. It's probably got some kind of sacred significance. Yeah, I want it for my sacred bathroom.  Finn?  Oh, my jah! Finn's become one with the lamb!  Huh? Jake! You see this crazy jazz? We'll get through this, my bro. I swear I'm gonna get you out of that lamb.  Jake! Come on. Quit messing with me. Whoa! Ow. Ow.  Ow.  Wish I knew how to free you, bro.  Me too, bro. Pbbbbbt! Thbbt! Thbbbt! Pbbbbbt! Beemo, stop fake-farting! But Finn always loved Beemo farting. Thbbt! Thbbt!  Hmm. That's it! We'll do all Finn's favorite stuff till he comes out! Beemo, play Finn's favorite song! Okay!  three baby spiders  What?! No!  No! Not this song!  The rain came down, and it was no fun  Are you hearing this, buddy? Guys, I haven't liked this song since I was 2! Aggggh!  Cut it out!   ICE KING: Leaf princess! Come to me, my arboreal beauty! Gotcha!  It's just a dumb, old leaf, you dumb, old Ice King. I know, but it's mine. Wait! What? Ice King, you can hear me? Yes. Why? Are you making fun of me or something? No, it's just no one else can see me or hear me talk. Ohh. Yeah. You're trapped in the spirit realm. I can see all things spirit with my "Wizard eyes"! Man, never thought I'd be happy to talk to you, Ice King. Can you help me get free? Oh, yeah. I know all the ins and outs. And I'd do anything for a friend like you.  Quiet, Gunther. Can't you see I'm hanging with Finn?  I know I say that a lot, but this time, it's true. Anyways, where do all these spirits come from? Oh, there are portals all over the universe. I have one in my basement. Every once in a while, a real cutie pie drifts through. Oh! Gosh, there she is. Mmm. Oh, yeah.  Sick. What? I swear I never touch 'em. I can't! Can't touch this! Can't touch this! Can't touch this, either!  Yep, I can't kill any of them.  I hate them. Okay, all right. Enough messing around. Let's get you free from the spirit plane. Cool.  So, the only way to get out of the spirit world is to stick all these lousy things in the spirit hole down there, then plug up the hole with that. And doing that will send me back to normal? Mm-hmm! Trust me! We are tur-bros! Turbo bros. Turbros. Turbobros. So be it.    All right, Finn. This ought to free you from your body prison. Couple of rounds of Kompy's Kastle will jog your psychic Schnapps. That's what I think. Co-op mode, like we always do. Oh, yeah!  Come on, Finn. Drop the drawbridge. Kompy's bloodlust meter's going down. Let me help you there. Wazza! You love Kompy. Idid it! Whew! I did it.  I'm ready, Ice King. Make me normal now. Ohh, that's not all of them. There's this other guy that watches me. He'ssuper-creepy. Do you see it? Oh, it sees you. Catch it and put it in the spirit hole! In the spirit hole, where it can't see me anymore -- so you can be free! Huh? Get it! Get it! Ugh! Aah! Get it in the hole! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! ICE KING: Yes!  It's gone! Sonow I can go back to normal? Uhwait, though. What? There's this last guy you got to get. He's pretty much the worst. He usually leaves these gross heads around, but I'm not seeing them anywhe-- Aah! Ew! There it is! There it is! Wan wan! Wan wan wan! Noooooo! No! Don't come near me! What is that? It's from the dead one. He leaves these heads around everywhere. I can't even touch them, but it still creeps me out. Wan wan! Please get rid of him! What do I do? Follow the heads? Yes, the heads! Oh, snow, please! All right, man. I'll get it. Wan wan. Where's your daddy, huh? Is he hiding in there? Wan wan.  Ugh! Better get back in the spirit hole, dead one. Blagh. Okay.  Hyah!  Ugh! Agh!  Wan wan wan! Hyup! Oof! Oh, bolts! Whoo! Yeah, get him! Boosh!  Oh, my -- what?! The cave? How the? Weird. That's weird, but whatevs, though.  Whatevs. Ice King?! Ice Ki-i-i-ng?! Where'd you go, Simon?  Ice King? Oh, me, oh, moy, oh, fa-la-loy Everyone sing my song of joy The child of man who touched the lamb Is soon to be my new best friend All to me, can't you see? For I will never set him free! I had no bro in all of Ooo But now I've got one, Finn the hu--  FINN: Dude, come on! What? Ha ha, Finn! You fell right into for my brilliant plan that I formed out of the thin air like a true magi! Not only did I get you to remove those horrible creatures from my castle, but now you're trapped, and only I can see you. So, if you want friends, this is it, pal.  I'm gonna re-open the hole. No, wait! My plan fell apart! My new plan is that you don't open the hole and I destroy the porcelain lamb, which will bring you back to the material plane.   Jake.  Ugh! Blah! Give me that lamb! No!  Finn's trapped in here! That's why I have to smash it! You donk! I will smash you! Blaaaaaaaah! Escape! Aah! My winter body! I was gonna start up on the elliptical again, but I got depressed, okay?  Don't look at me!  Ow!  Ooooh!  Aaah! They're touching me for real! Ew! Great. Now we're both stuck in here. Aaah! Finn, give me your clothes! Stop! I need a buffer! Gah! Oh, geez! Come on!  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. They were just touching me on the body. I'm sorry. Whoa. Do that again. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. They were touching my body. I'm sorry. Your hand is affecting the TV! We must have some kind of subtle effect on the material plane. Cool. What do you think, Finn? Can we pull back the veil of static and reach into the source of all being? Behind this curtain of patterns, this random pattern generator. So clever. Right here, in every home, watching us from a one-sided mirror.  Whoops! Just wizard-talking to myself. It's okay, but let's use our subtle influence to break the lamb. Yeah, a'ight. You mean like this? Whoooosh. Yeah, man! Whoo! It's working, man! Combine the swirls! Okay. Wazza! Whoa! Finn, is that you?  Yes! Finn! Finn! Finn! Whoa! That was beautiful.  Let's go flush this in the sacred bathroom.  Jake, if I beat you, you have to call me "sensei" for a month. Deal. Hi, guys. ALL: 'Sup, Turtle Princess? Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Argh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Get your hands off me, Steven! Yah! You too, Chad! Hey, girl. Hey, girl. Brought you some little fruit pies. Awesome. How you doing out here? Turtle Princess, the men out here will not leave me alone!  It must be nice. Nah, it's horrible. They just want me for my lumps.  These lumps aren't for sale, Billy! -  - Ugh! Aren't you sick of men going after your turtle lumps? Actually, I've never been able to work my T-Lumps. I just know what I read in books.  Hey, you should write a book telling me how to do it. Oh, my glob. Turtle Princess, I always wanted to write trashy books for ladies!  Hyah! Back up off me, Ricky! Yeah, everyone needs to know that when I work these lumps, no man is immune to their influence. Jake's ball landed over here, Beemo!  LSP, Finn would be perfect as the test subject for your lump studies. Yay! I win! Bow to your sensei. Aw!  You got to go undercover and conduct your lump science on him. Prove to the world that even a white knight like Finn is no match for the power of your lumps. I'll do it -- for the world! And for you, girl. Oh, girl! Day one -- on my way to Finn and Jake's. Side note -- I look fresh to death with my new dress and purse. Mm. Mm. Mm. Hello?  Hey, Jake. Is Finn home? Ohh! 'Sup, LSP?  Oh, hey. I'm answering that ad you put out for the "Adventure Secretary." What? Ugh! Hold on. I'll get it.  Hold on. It's down in there. Okay, wait. I got it. Here you go. "Wanted -- Adventure Secretary."  Smells like fruit pie. It's nice of you to want to be our secretary, but we don't need one. Dude, look at her. Mmm. Oh, glob. Yeah, it's sad. Come on. We got to help her. Ah. All right, LSP, come inside. Awesome. Totally nailed the interview.  I'm gonna need a secretary desk. Rah!  I'm starving! What's for dinner?! Oh. Uh we got some blueberries. Jake has saltines. Yuck. Looks like I'll have to bust out these cobras to get a better dinner.  Hey, Finn. You got anything better to eat? Oh, cool -- old spaghetti. I'm gonna go heat this up. Chapter one --"Gotcha." Have a good night. See you in the morning. Good night, you guys! Finn is even more overpowered by my lumps than I thought. I guess at the end of the day, it's all about the lumps. TURTLE PRINCESS RINGTONE: Hey, girl. Hey --  Hey, girl. Oh, Turtle Princess, this book is coming out awesome! Oh, good, girl. I can't wait to read it. Thanks, girl. - Good night, girl. - Good night, girl.   Huh? What's that? 'Sup, LSP? What are you guys doing? We're carrying these rocks on an adventure up to the mystery mountains. Oh, nuh-uh! I am not gonna carry rocks! That's okay. Jake can carry them. Yep. Ugh! Fine. You're welcome, Finn. Ugh! My arms weren't meant to carry so many rocks, you guys. Come on, LSP. You can make it. Ugggggh!  RINGTONE: Hey, girl. Hey --  Turtle Princess, you can't call me. You're gonna blow my cover! Good morning, girl. Good morning, girl. Would you be mad at me if I ask out Billy, that vulture who was hitting on you? I think he's cute, and Hey, LSP, shake a leg. Can't talk right now, girl.  The Loch of Phantoms. Princess Bubblegum said the rocks would show us the safe path. This is way too boring for my book. Oh! My shoulder strap! Oh, my orange juice is coming out! Ha! Gotch-- huh? Jake. "Kerploop!" JAKE:  "Kerploop." Not gotcha? All right!  Ughhh! This place is plops, Finn! We can meet you back at the tree house later, if you want. That weird light.  Hey, Finn! Finn, my dress is slipping! Huh? Listen, LSP, we gotta be careful. Whooooo! My dress! - No, LSP! It's not safe! - Aaah! Don't look! He-e-e-e-e-y! Oh. Hey, Fi-i-i-nn.  She's stuck in there! We gotta bust through this wall! I knew you couldn't resist me, Finn. Oh, lump. I took it too far. My powerful lumps have turned Finn into a grody monster! Get away, Finn! Aah! No! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Hyah! Aah! I-I can't look!  Aah!  That was so crazy! What just happened?! Oh. Um, Bubblegum sent us on a quest to destroy these cursed mirrors. Evil stuff happens when you look into them. Oh, glob. I had to look, 'cause I looked so good. LSP, you don't need a mirror to know you look good. You're beautiful on the inside. Like your brain and stuff. Thanks for saying that stuff. And for saving me from those mirror-yous. That was pretty nice. Okay, time to write. Gonna make this trashy. Turtle Princess will be all  "Oh, my gosh! Number-one best seller!"  Heh heh. Yeah.  What is he doing out there? Sometimes, after an adventure, he likes to sit out there and think. RINGTONE: Hey, girl. Hey --  - Hello? - Hey, girl. Are you almost done with your book? Oh! I'm working on it. I've been doing so much research. Did Finn fall victim to your lumps? Um yeah. Great! Bring in your manuscript right away. Click! Yeah a book about how I'm hot and Finn only wants -- he's so hot. Old spaghetti. "Kerploop." You're beautiful on the inside. Finn has the hottest lumps, but his lumps are on the inside. Aaaargh! He's great! Uh bye, LSP.  This isn't what you said it'd be about. I know. I -- I love it! Oh, my glob! Finn, you've probably been wondering where I've been for the last few hours. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I have. Finn, I was never really your secretary, Finn. I was writing a book about how you were a slave to my lumps 'cause I'm so hot, Finn! Oh. Okay. But you're the one who's hot, Finn! Wow. Uh thanks! No. Thank you. LSP, you're wearing garbage for clothes! Gotcha. Aah!  


    Don't ever mess with me again. Who was that?  The Princess of the Fire Kingdom. Dude. I think I have a crush. What do you know about her, Jake? I was trying to help you get over your Princess Bubblegum sad times by hooking you two up. But she's evil, man. You shut your dirty mouth! Dirty?!  Huh. No, really, man! Her dad said she was evil! Nah, man. I peeped beyond her burning gaze and noshed hot lunch with her soul. She ain't evil. She's passionate. Help me track her down. Mmmmm Come on, man. I really like her. Help me out. Jake.

I really didn't You told me you liked me, and you made my flame grow brighter. But then you put me out Which hurt! BOTH: Gyah!  You're trying to impede me. That must be your purpose. But fire's purpose is to burn. So I'm going to turn this land into my fire kingdom! No! BOTH: Ooh! Ow! Hot! Hot! She's headed for the Goblin Kingdom! We need to defeat this fiery she-beast! I can't fight her, man. I'm still into her. Finn! What's more important your love for that screwball dame or being a hero and saving the lives of innocent goblin folk?  Being a hero. All right! Come on! Let's go build fireproof suits!  I got to get back to her! Dude, slow down, or your fire suit will be junk. Ooh! Is bags of old bread fireproof?  Jake! You found Neptr! I am the ultimate hide-and-seek champion. and you guys did not find me.  Oh, plops. We forgot about the game. Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I missed you, creator. And we missed you, too, but, Neptr, right now, we need you to To count to 100 while you hide? One, two, three, four, five Neptr. Will you help us build fireproof suits? You cannot tell, but I am giving a thumbs-up.  Working for the master Preventing a disaster Building giant robots from aluminum and plaster Faster, a cast to build the blaster Yes, for foam and water Yes, for when it's hotter I've got it, it's no bother 'Cause I live to please you, father  I am finished. I sure hope Flame Princess is okay. Ha ha! We are as one, creator. Jake, you think Flame Princess is okay? Du-u-u-u-de! I feel like I could touch the heavens and sock angels!

Everyone's fine. See?  Yeah, we're alive. So, how'd everything go with Flame Princess? She hugged me, then left. Whoa! How did it feel? It hurt.    This party is so crazy!


Yo, man, what's going on? Oh, I found this crystal on our doorstep. It's pretty mysterious. I'm trying to find information about it using the holo-book. Uh, that's cool. But you know what's really cool? Tough guy contests. Whoo-hoo!  Tough boys!  Wait, man. Doesn't this look like Tree Trunks' lipstick? That's impossible. Tree Trunks exploded in the scary dark forest after she ate that crystal gem apple. Remember? Yeah, I remember. Come on, man. Tough-guy-contest me. You got what it takes to rip it? Uh yeah. Then let's get it on. Hyah! Yeah-yo! Hyah! Do it, man. Do it. Raaa! Oh! No! Gotcha, dude. I'm gonna break out. No way. Ha ha! I'm breaking out with my fat. I win, Finn. Finn? Finn! Finn, are you okay? I was just messing with you, dude. I was just messing with you. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm just gonna rest my muscles. Oh, dang it, Jake. You can't get all out of control like that. Why am I like this like this like this? Jake, what did you do to your brother? We were just playing, and then I got out of control. I'm sorry, dad. No, son, you did good. Having no self-control makes you a tough galoot, like me. But I don't want to hurt nobody. Well, that's too bad, kid, 'cause you're gonna hurt everybody. Noooo! Whatev, daddy. Hmph! Hmph! Hmph! I'm never gonna hurt anybody ever -- starting now. What's up, dude? Finn, you're okay. I was scared that I mashed your potatoes too hard last night. Ha! You didn't mash my potatoes. You didn't even make me cry silently into my pillow last night for In fact, you ready to go again, tough stuff? No. No more, dude. - What? I never want to lose control again, man. I'm going totally soft. You look like a wuss. Mm-hmm. Hey, the crystal's glowing a different color. Hmm. Jake! Whoa. What's it -- Chip, chap, chop! What's going on? Uh, which one of you is Finn the human? Depends on who's asking. Are y'all good or evil? Uh we're good. Oh. I'm Finn. - Get him! - Aah! Hey, you guys, put my bro down. Jake! Finn! Ugh! - Hey. Hey, man, what happened? I don't know, but I'm trapped in this crystal ball. Get me out of here. Okay, I'll try to do it using controlled conversation. Halt. Hey, man, I'm Jake. Beat it. I want to know why you took my buddy, and I'm not gonna use force to get it out of you. I'm just following orders, bub. Whose orders? Um well, it's a secret, but part of it is we're turning Finn into a crystal. Jake, you should stop these guys now. Aaaaah! Oh, man. Get me out of here! No. You're gonna look awesome and crystal, like us. Can't we work this out like gents? Get lost. - Whoa! Jake, lose control, flip out on those guys. No, dad. I've got to control myself.  Control, control, control, control  Jake! Help! My arm! Aah! Whoa. Okay, okay. I'm hatching a controlled plan. All right, man, move out of the way and let me get my friend. Nope. Not doing it. Then I'll have to move you myself with my mind. You're gonna hurt yourself. Stop it. Your time is running out, little dog. Hey, speed it up in there, guys. Okay. Turn up the juice, mang. Yeah, mang. Aah. Aah! Jake! Help! Finn! Don't hurt my buddy. No, Jake, no. Don't lose control. Jake. Jake. Come on, punch them, Jake. Punch everybody. Why not? Come on! Why not? No punchies. I am in control. Who are you talking to? Nobody, man! Don't look at me! Whoa! Did you guys see that? Yes. Yeah. Don't make fun of him. He's having problems. Everybody has -- aah! Aaaaah! Ugh! Stupid ghost dad. I'll show him. Ooh. Okay. Intimidate them with controlled attack. Hurry up, guys. I got to drop a crystal donk. Oh, come on. I don't want to hear that. Hey, whatever, man. I ain't ashamed. I got -- whoa. What -- what the Open up! Feel my controlled attack. Whaaaa! Psssh! Whaaaa! Psssh! Whaaaaaaaa! Psssh! Stop it. I'm not hurting you, am I? No, you freak. Well, there's a lot more where that came from, so you best tell me why you're turning Finn into a crystal. Or what, you'll touch me? So help me, I will touch you. Aah! Jake! Aah! Help! Finn, oh, no. Cut it out. He looks good. My body! No! My bud! Eh, let him in. He can't do nothing now. I'm sorry, Finn. I'm superlame. And now you're dead. I'm not dead. I'm just all crystal-stiff. Oh. Get your hands off my lover. - That voice. - It sounds like -- Yes, Finn, it's me, Tree Trunks. But in this world, I'm known as Quartzion the crystal queen. Oh, my grosh. You're alive! Oh, I'm more than alive, Finn. After I ate that crystal apple in the scary dark forest, I was transported to this crystal dimension, where I became ruler of the crystal men. And the crystal men are all in love with me. - Love you, Quartzion! - I love you! - We love you! - Love you! Yes, yes, I know. But your love is not enough. Aah! I wanted you, Finn, so you could be transformed into my sexy crystal king. Tree Trunks, you've gone bananas with crystal power. Finn, it's not sexy for a king to call his queen bananas. Aah! Jake, you've totally got to stop her. I'll try, man, but I'm still figuring out my biz. Here I come, Tree Trunks. Taste my gentle rubs. Whoa there. Don't you put your junk on my trunk. Go, Jake! Go! She's too sassy and powerful. Ow! Jake, Jake, I brought someone here to see you. It's your brother. Jermaine? Are you dead? No, man, we're just dreaming at the same time. Well, I'm sorry about that time I beat you up. Yo, that was an accident. I knew you were just horsing off. But, dad, you said I'm gonna hurt everybody. Yeah, everybody. I don't know, dad. That doesn't really help me. Everybody who is evil, Jake. Let me finish next time, hmm, yeah? Oh. Well, then I'm over it then. Jake, kick Tree Trunks in the tummy. She's probably still got that crystal gem apple inside her. That must be giving her all her powers. Marry me, Finn. We can snuggle through time and space and kiss each other in an alternate dimensional plane. Hyah! Oh! Oh, dear. Yeah! T.T., you're back. Oh, Jake, I was behaving so inappropriately. I'm so embarrassed. Oh, shush, Tree Trunks. If I had a penny for every time someone went crazy, hopped up on magic energy I'd be Abraham Lincoln. Tree Trunks, you're okay. Finn! I'm okay, too! Oh, Finn, I was trapped here for so long, and all I could think about was you and how you're so nice to me. And I-I just wanted to say I think you're cute, and I like you. Okay, okay. Let's go. Finn, when we get home, it's apple-pie time. Oh!  Apple pie in the oven Tell me you can taste my lovin'   This party is so crazy!


    Walking, walking, walking -- hambone break! Whoo-hoo! Hey, hey, get away from me.  Quit it!  Food for a beggar?  Food for a poor old man? Geez Louise, guy. So, you got any, kid? Food? l got this little piece of sugar.  Nuts. l'm frickin' all about sugar. But l'm even more all about feeding hobos! JAKE: Wait, Finn. Maybe helping this starving homeless guy is the wrong thing to do. Why? l don't know. l-l said ''Maybe.'' A hero always helps someone in need. And besides, he's probably secretly an elf who will reward us for being nice. Here you go, buddy. Whoa!  You know, believe it or not, l'm not really a beggar. l'm actually a  Magic Man  Whoa! Ah, yeah! He's -- he's magic! l didn't -- l didn't expect this. Magic! Away!  Think happy thoughts -- Little, cute bees, little babies, tiny, tiny bunnies. What is wrong with you, Magic Man?! You gave me that candy. Now l'll do you a favor in return -- a magic favor!  A mystical, magical favor  Whoa! Wha-- ugh!  Whoa, dude!  For you  Why'd you do that?! Because this day, a magical life lesson comes to you. No, change me back! Not until you appreciate what a jerk l am. Wazoo! What a nutty guy. What the heck, man?! What kind of deal is that?! l help somebody out, and they make me a stinky foot?!  You smell pretty good. Get off of me, man! l can't be a hero if l'm a big, good-smelling foot! Maybe you're looking at this magic gift all wrong. Now that you're a huge foot, you can kick evil's butt, like, way more times as hard. You're 1 00% kick, man! Why are you being so level-headed about this? Don't be a siss, Finn. Here, come on, kick my butt. You're the siss, siss! Hah! Agh! Ouch! Ooh, ouch! See, man? Let's give your foot body a shot. No, dude! l want to go find that Magic Man and get my body back! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Just be a foot for a llttle bit.  Okay, l will.  Awesome, dude. You'll never regret this.  Okay, when the next monster comes along, he'll step on that trigger over there, sending your giant foot body into the monster's crotch! This sucks, dude. Shh!  We're evil! Our crotch -- our evil crotch!  What'd l tell you? You're a great hero! Let's go set up some more crotch catapults so we can laugh and be heroes. No, Jake. Let's find that Magic Man. Finn, being an enormous crotch-kicking foot is a gift. Don't scorn a gift.  Town on fire! This looks like a job for foot Finn stomping ability! But l-l can't even bend these big, fat toes, man. You can do it, Finn. What'd l teach you, dude? Not to scorn the kicking of people in the crotch? You got it! Now l'm gonna go rescue all the babies in town -- only the babies. Get your hero on, dude! Aaaah!  Unh! Okay, you can do this, Finn. Start small, man. l'm taking you down!  lt's hot! Oh, man, l'm smoking hot! Please, help me out! l can't move! lt's another one of those freaks! He probably started this fire! No, l didn't start any -- Throw him under the bridge with the others! ALL: Get rid of the freak!  Freak! Freak! Stay out of our town, freak! Unh! l'm not a freak. l'm a hero. Finn! Jake, how'd you find me? Oh, l can sense when you're about to cry. lt's like a mother/daughter thing. l'm not gonna cry, man! l just feel like crying. We have to find that magic guy and get my body back now! What we have to do is find out what reeks under this bridge.  - Jake! Ew, it's blocking out your good foot smell. Get back here! Ugh, it -- it smells like vomit on fire. lt's like fancy cheese in an old guy's mouth. Welcome, travelers. Aah! l am Gork, leader of Freak City. Ah, l can see one of you has felt the Magic Man's touch. Yeah. You know that guy? l will tell you all that l know.  We are the accursed ones, all once normal guys and gals who crossed paths with the Magic Man. That's Zap, The Arm.  Trudy, The Waist.  That's Wee Wee and Gorflax. They were turned into tonsils. And that's Kim. But, please, make yourselves at home. Would you like something to drink? Do you have any orange juice? No. Well, uh, l don't know. Maybe. Uh, l don't think so. l'll go check.

Thanks for being cool and all, but what do you know about this Magic Man? How do we catch him? Oh, he can't be caught. He's got maglc. And we're worthless freaks. We can't ever beat him.

No, it's not, Zap! lt's not a living! lt's dookie diapers! l don't want to be a foot! Well, get used to it. We did.

Do it up. Awesome.  Here we go. Jake, stop screwing around. You're gonna make me give into depression. Eh, what are you gonna do about it?

We're not afraid! Are you sure about that? You're darn right we are!  Whoop! Give us our bodies back!  Why should l? You still act like a hero only so you can get what you want. Oh. You were trying to teach us to be kind without expecting anything in return. l should've given you that sugar cube without even thinking about a reward. Wrong! Whoa! Whoa! - Ah, geez! - Finn! You've gifted us nothing but heartache, Magic Man! What's the life lesson in that?!  Yes, my children, you are so close to the answer. Answer thls! Get his eyes! Cut him in the eyes! l wish l'd never been nice to you 'cause you're just a big jerk! Oh, yes, that's it! You've finally learned your lesson. And now l'm off to spread my teachings to more sissy do-gooders. You're welcome! Man, l frickin' hate that guy. But at least now we can all go back to our regular lives. Well, actually We like being like this. Yeah, we're strong together. ALL: Bye, Finn! Thank you! Oh, okay. Bye, guys. See you later. Wait, so, what was the lesson we just learned? Maybe it was, don't give your sugar to jerks. Speaking of jerks, what the blubins, man?! Why wouldn't you help me turn back into a boy?! Well, because l kind of always wanted  What? l said, ''l kind of always wanted to be a foot myself.'' You could be a foot right now. l saw you change into a foot twice yesterday. lt's complicated, man. You'll understand when you're older.  


     Mnnh-choo. Mm. What?! Jake, I told you to stop staring at me right at the time when I wake up. I'm staring because I can't move my head!  No, really, I can't move. I can't move, either! What's happening?!  What? What is that? - Hey, who is that? - Who goes there? Jake, use your peripheral vision!  Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!  Ice King!  I shouldn't be laughing. I'm sorry. Oh, I know -- I'll do the opposite. Oh, boohoo!  Oh, this is weird. What did you do to us, Ice King?! Whoa, whoa. I didn't "do" anything to you, okay? Come on, guys. I'm your friend. So why can't we move?! Ooh! Because I froze you, with this. FINN: "Freezing Potion A"? I sprayed it on you while you slept. Wenk! Wenk! No! Gunter, no! This one likes to break bottles, don't you? Tuckity tuck. Let's move to the living room.  Why are you doing this, Ice King? ICE KING: Why'? Well, because I love you guys, but you don't love me, do you? You've tried to kill us like four times. I only try to kill you 'cause you're princess-blockin' me all the time! Anyway, now that you're frozen, we can bond and stuff, and the sooner we do, the sooner I can spray you with this. FINN: "Unfreezing Potion A"? Uh, I underlined the "Un--" so I wouldn't mix 'em up. Just unfreeze us now, man. Yeah, 'cause we're already friends. We are'? Mm-hmm. What's my favorite color? BOTH: Um. Yellow? Orange? Ohh, uh. Lavender, lavender, yeah! Uh, Rainbow? You don't love me. I know a lot about you guys. Jake, you don't put ice in your drink because you have sensitive teeth. What? And, Finn, your favorite food is meatloaf. How did you And, Jake, sometimes you don't cry because you're afraid of real emotion. It's okay. Let it out.  You don't love me. Wenk! Wenk, vvenk! Wenk! Wenk! Bad penguin! Wenk.  You lock your bottles?  In this economy?  Well, I'm gonna go make some lemonade. Don't touch my lemons, Ice King! Ice King! Jake, look!  Gunter! No, Gunter! No! No, Gunter! No! Wenk. BOTH: No, Gunter! No! Aah, aah! Aaah! Gunter, stop! Wenk, wenk! What are we gonna do?! When someone loses one sense, their other senses are enhanced, like a blind man who can smell and hear really well. I'm gonna try using my now-enhanced brain sense to make contact with an astral beast who will help us. What? Whee!  Whee! Astral beast, come to me! Come to me, astral beast. I've got lemonade! You want some, Jake?  Huh? Gunter! No, Gunter! No bottles! Look at me! Wenk.  What am I gonna do with you?  Oh, you.  You're going to have to wear a leash.  This should keep you out of trouble. Now, our first bonding activity will be walking in each ether's shoes, so to speak. To better understand each ether's perspectives, we're going to dress up like each other. Me first!    It's Adventure Time! I'll save you, Princess! Let's have babies, Princess! And let's teach them to be good babies! Oh, Princess, sure, I'll kiss you. I'm a hero. Hey, Finn, uh, don't you think it's weird there's two Finns? Finn? Not talking? Now I'm gonna dress like Jake.  No!! No, no, Ho, no, no! Okay, okay. We'll bond in another way. So, I wanted to show you something telling of my soul. Wenk. Wenk. I take artful black-and-white photographs of my penguirfs body parts. Photography is art. Uh, let's see some art. Okay, first one -- see how Gunter is staring into the camera? He's saying, "Here I am. Look at me. Accept me." Okay, second one -- this is a haunting image of a penguin's flipper. Look at how it penetrates the negative space. I can't take this anymore! Dang it, Finn, what are you doing in there?! ICE KING: Oh, yes, this one is very clear.  Astral beast, where are you?! You come here now!! Whee! ICE KING: Yeah, I've thought about it a lot. Ohh. And having a little gallery show might be nice -- a little cheese, a little cider. Could be nice, you know? Maybe bring a veggie plate. I think people would appreciate that. Key! Gunter! Gunter! ICE KING: Yup, could be real nice. Gunter, psst! Ps-s-s-st! Come here, Gunter!  We-e-e-e-n k! This next one is very rewarding.  Grab it, Gunter! Pick it up! Pick it up! What are you waiting for? Just grab it! Wenk. Wenk, vvenk, wenk. Wenk, wenk. Gunter, come back! Wenk, wenk. - Gunter! - Wenk? You are being naughty, Gunter! You've interrupted my thing! Now, you stay right here and go to sleep! Sleep!  Wenk. Wenk. Aww! So cute. All right, back to art. Gunter. Gunter, wake up. Go getthe key.  Consarn it, Gunter! Okay, time for a break. Who wants lemonade? Ooh, don't want to lose this. Gunter! Jake! No! You're bonding without me! Wenk. It's for your own good, sweetie. Now, then  Wait, you're sleeping up here? Well  not before our next bonding activity -- late-night gab session. Do you want to talk about girls? Do you have a crush on anyone? Uh, yeah, my girlfriend, Lady Rainicorn. Ooohhhhhh! Don't worry -- I won't tell anyone.  Know who I have a crush on? Princess Bubblegum. You don't say. Oh, I do I've liked her for quite some time. Feels weird to say it out loud.  What? Ohh, he fell asleep with his eyes open! Finn! Finn, snap out of it! Astral beast, where are you?! Show yourself! Why not?! Does this dance please you, astral beast?! Does this please you?!  This is it! The astral beast cometh.  Rr-rr-rr rr-rrrr!  Who's hungie? Jake, you hungie? I'm hungry. All right, fair enough. Well, how about I make us some omelets? That sounds pretty good, actually. I'm gonna put my foot in it. Eating a part of me will bring us closer together. I'll be inside of you.  Dude, you're back! Yup. I just got back from the astral plane. Where's your astral beast? It's on its way. It's gonna be awesome. What kind of beast? Well, I'm not sure. I couldn't see it in the astral plane. But I heard it. It sounded really intense.  Maybe a gorilla? A gorilla, huh? Aw, junk! Did I summon butterflies?!  I'm the worst. Hey, come on, now. You're not the worst. Yeah, I am. No, you're not -- you're the best. At being the worst. Mmnnnhhh! FINN: What are you doing? I'm using my enhanced brain sense to tell your astral beast to slap some sense into you. Oh. That's cool. I deserve it. Mmnnnnhh! Noyoudon't! Well, I don't want to use too much foot. It'll overpower the eggs -- take away from the omelet. Huh? Aaah! Finn and Jake and a bunch of butterflies and a sword! Ohm  What do you want from me? What do we want? We want you to unfreeze us, you lunatic! No, we're not friends yet. You haven't eaten my omelet. Aah! Ohh! Aah! Ohh! Friends don't eat each other, Ice King. That's not how friends work. Now, unlock this bottle and unfreeze us! Ohh! All right. I don't know how you're doing this, but it is impressive.  Wait a minute. Which bottle is 'Eh-- I think they brought me the wrong bottle. GunteÃ¯Â¬Âs still upstairs. Gunter! Gunter! Gunter! Gunter!  


     FlNN:  Here l go! - Yeah! Whoo-hoo!  Hmm Awesome! Someone needs our help!  What is it about ''Henchman for Life'' that you don't understand?  Oh, come on! Dude, it's Marceline, the Vampire Queen. Huh?! Can't you find the compassion to release this poor old body? ''Henchman for Life'' means ''Henchman for Life''! You still petrified of vampires? No. l'm not. Fall on the ground for me! Yes, Mistress. Unh! Now cry for me. Okay. l don't want to cry, but l shall cry for you.  Hey! Cut that out! Oh, if it isn't my favorite little goody two shoes Finn. Stop making this poor old dude cry! l can make him do whatever l want. Watch. Henchman, amuse me.  Stop it! Now hop around in a circle.

Do you mean it? Uh, well  Heck yeah! Deal! Old henchman, you are free. Whoo-hoo! What are you doing, man? Hey, Jake. Eep! l couldn't watch that old man suffer, Jake. My code of honor wouldn't allow it.  ''Oh, my code of honor wouldn't allow it.''  Grrr! Hey! Yes, Jake? What would you like to talk about?! Aah! l want to help you out of this, man, but she scares the filling out of my doughnut. Let's just leave. l can't. As a hero, l'm bound by my wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-rd! Finn!  Don't worry, dude! l'll figure something out! You're lucky, Finn. Your first job as henchman is to help me feed.  Feed? What does she mean? Like -- l-like oats? Like sentient beings or oats? lt doesn't matter. l can handle it. Sounds like dinner. Finn, open the door.  Open it already! No way, Marceline! l'm not gonna open this door if innocent people will be hurt! Aren't you bound by your word to do as l say, hero? l  Yes.  Huh? Sorry about this. Aah! Hold him down.  MARCELlNE: Are you enjoying this, Finn? No!  Grrr! Don't you worry, Finn. l'll get you out of there. l've got a perfect plan. - Aah! l'm not running away, Finn! This is just part of my plan! Please, human boy, let me go. l'm sorry, Sir. l'm bound by my Code of Honor to do what she says. l understand, son. l was married myself once. Wait, wait! l'm not married to -- Ohh! Enough talking! Dinner is served!  No! Grr! No! How dare you, henchman. l order you to let me feed! Aah! Unh! Aah! Uh Uh Blah! Aah! Nooooooo!  Mmm. That red bow tie was delicious. Ohh, ugh. Huh? What's wrong, Finn? l -- l thought -- l thought you were -- Oh, my. A white tie! Thank you so much. This is so beautiful. Ahh. But -- but -- What? You know l eat the color red sometimes. Oh, yeah. Okay. We've got plenty more evil to do! Man, wha-- what's wrong with this girl? l -- l can't tell if she's messing with me or -- or what. Hey, Finn, you thinking about how that guy's bow tie sort of looked like a bra? Huh? No! l know this place seems a little dead But don't worry. lt'll soon beun-dead.  Corpses buried in mud that's black, from death, l command you, to come back! How are you? What's happening? Are you ready to lead an evil army of the undead? Never!  Okay! l'll do it!  Don't worry, dude. l'm coming to help you. Yaaaaaaaaah! Huh? What's that noise? Aaaah! Sorry, Finn.  Excited to hear the wild screams of an entire castle?  Oh, yeah. That sounds bombastic, honey. Hey, l'm gonna run up ahead and scout it out for you, sugar. My boss is gonna sack your castle! Oh! Well, that's certainly bad news for us. Lisby! Who is at the door? Someone who wishes to sack the nut castle. Why would you want to sack my nut castle on my second son's 1 st birthday? Seize him! No!  Listen! You hear that? My Master is marching here with her army of the undead! Oh! How wonderful! Listen to me!  Everybody, run for your lives! Ha ha ha! l wrote this next song about a fisherman.  You look so cute sittin' in your boat l wanna suck out your eyeballs and rip out your throat l wanna suck out your eyeballs and rip out your throat  Don't do this, Marceline! l beg you! Don't do what? You're late, Marceline! My son has been dylng to hear your undead music! Wha? Oh, l forgot! Marceline is playing tonight. Okay. So she makes things seem bad, and then -- or her personality makes them seem bad and  l'm overreacting. - Hey! - Huh? Why are you thinking so hard? Just party hard. Whoo-hoo!  All right! Whoo-hoo!  Hey, castle crasher! Hey, Marceline. You like cute things, right? Uh, yeah. Sure. Why? Then, you might love this. The cutest dimple plant ever! Here -- eat some of its fruit. See what happens. Okay.  A dimple! Okay, henchman, now l need you to do something. What is it? l want to you to take this dimple plant outside and kill it. What?! Use my axe-bass. l'm gonna murder you. l'm not entirely sure why. l'm sure this will end happy.  Aah! l don't get it. There's always a twist to the stuff Marceline makes me do! But where's the twist in bumping off this bush? There is no twist. Kill it now! But what --  You should have hacked it to pieces when it was still adorable. l thought --  Whoa! Hyah!  Bleh! Sick! Whoa! Oh, boy. Waaaaah!  Hyah!  Not bad. For a henchman. Hmm. FlNN: Hey, can't the sun, like, destroy you? Yeah, it hurts. But l kind of like it. Reminds me when l'd scrape my knees up as a kid and my mom would patch me up. You know what l'm saying? Uh, Jake told me l came out of a cabbage.  Hey, Finn, l need you to strangle some Pixies! Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Whoa. Why are you being so casual about that? Killing pixies is some hard-core evil. l'm not falling for your junk anymore, lady. You just like saying poop that jacks with my brain. What are you talking about? l --  Dang, man. l didn't think you'd ever catch on.  l knew it! Hey, what about your old henchman? Who was that guy? Oh, just an old diving buddy. So, ready to go strangle some pixies? Yeah, man. l mean wo-man! Oh, no. My buddy is totally under her vampire spell! Die, unholy thing! Jake? Ow!  Aah! Marceline! JAKE: l'm stakin' that vampire and setting you free, no matter how terrified l am! She's all right, man! She's still controlling your mind with evil! Now back off and let me vanquish her from existence! l can't let you do that, Jake.  l love you, brother. Aah! Oof!  Jake, listen! Marceline is not how she seems! She's a radical dame who likes to play games.  What are you even talking about, dude? Hyah!  Oh, man! Whoa! Aah! Marceline! Unh! Aah! Where is she? Uh l'm free. Jake, you faced your fear and saved me! l did? l did! Yeah!  l saved my bro from a scum-sucking vampire ls it cool? Yup. Finn, l owe you, big-time. Changing into a bat and hiding in your pack was genius. That's what henchmen are for. Oh, that reminds me. You're fired from your henchmanship. lt's no fun when l can't trick you. We're still on for pixie-strangling tomorrow, though, right? Definitely.

Where's Peace Master?! Gah, I am freakin' out here! - Princess, your chamomile tea. - Whfff! Thanks. Well, how do I check my e-mails on this?


(mouse squeaks) (penguins chirp) (screeches)  - Hmm. What is it? - It's looking droopier. But I've been pounding pickle juice like I was preggos. For the electrolytes. Well, switch back to water. But what I really want to know is, how are you feeling, Finn? What? Oh! I don't know. (imitates trumpet tooting) - I guess I don't feel anything. Bleh! - Okay, that's what I thought. You got to bounce back, man! You got burned by your bad dad, you lost your arm, and all the ladies say you don't talk to Flame Princess no more. Who's sayin' that? Finn, flowers thrive on good vibes. As your doctor, I'm ordering you to go out and have fun, okay? You want to go with me to Crab Princess' party tonight? - Uh, what? Like, as a date? - Sure. - That would be fun, right? - Finn, I don't date my patients. It's cool. Guess I'll go make out with Crab Princess. Okay. Tell her I said "hi"!  I'm lost in the darkness. What will this bring? - Autumn descends on me autumn. - What do I see? Oh, so beautiful! My heart it beats oh, so magical! I'm lost in the darkness. What will this bring?  (dance music plays) (sighs) Aah! Watch it, Crab Princess! - I'm sorry. - You ain't my man! So why are you all up in my lumps?! (grunts) Hey, Finn, could you pour this juice into my mouth? What? Pfft! Aah! - I can't reach my juice. - Yo, come on, bee! Geez! Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize Didn't realize what? That there's a person attached to this flower? Uh, yes. I'm sorry. But it's only because your flower's the greatest miracle of all time. It's just doing something to me. - I - Oh, that's cool. Thanks, Beezy. - My name's Breezy. - Never mind, Finn. (laughs, coughs) (laughing) So, uh, what are you doing here? Heh? Ah, well, I came here to make out with Crab Princess, but I sort of lost steam on the walk over. I don't know what crabs are into. I'm just gonna stop trying and let my flower wilt away. Who cares? - I'll try for you, man! - Whoa! Really? Yeah! I'm gonna help you, friend! (dance music continues) Hey, Emerald Princess, you know what would blow this party up? - What? - If we all got in a line and just showed off our moves. (clapping) Yeah! Do it! Oh, my glob! - Aah ha ha! Haa! - Thanks for walking me home, Finn. I'd invite you over, but you can't breathe underwater, right? Not usually, but can I have a kiss, please? Uh, okay - Okay, good night Crab Princess. - Good night, Finn! - (giggles, gurgles) Hey, you did it! - Oh, you're still here. Yeah. (chuckles) Just checking in On my buddy. So, how you feelin', buddy? Pretty grease. I made out with Crab Princess, so that's grease. But really I don't feel nothing. Maybe if I made out with lots of girls, I will feel something? Maybe I'll reach a "good vibe" saturation point. - And then my flower will feel good, too - Your flower feels good, yes. - Hey! Cut it out, Breezy! - Haha! I'm just messin' around. - We're buddies, right? - Yeah, Breezy, I like you. - You're a good wingman. - Yeah, wingman. I'm a girl, but all right! Let's wingman you some make-outs! (horn plays softly) (whispering) (horn blares wildly) (rattling) (upbeat music plays) (giggles) Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh! (indistinct conversations) (chuckles) What's up with your head? Eh, I'm trying something new. Hey! - How's it going, Miss? - Frozen Yogurt Princess. Whoa! You're a dead ringer for Flame Princess, with a smidge of princess bubblegum mixed in. - Guess you're still hung up on both of 'em, bro. - I ain't hung up on nobody! - Nobody! Breezy, let's get out of here. - Okay. She doesn't look anything like Flame Princess, does she? - I don't know who that is. - Exactly! I'm just trying to have fun. You know, doctor's orders. But I still ain't feelin' nothing. (sighs) Maybe I should just let this poor flower die. Nooo Listen, buddy, being a free spirit is fun and all, but you got a responsibility to that flower, just like I got a responsibility. Get this I'm actually a virgin queen bee. I was born to lead a hive, destined for a life of obligation and ritual. - Whoa! Bummer. - Yes. Once I drink of the royal jelly, - my carefree days are done. - Dang! That sounds like raw deez. Breezy, you got to stay free Free to make out with whatevs. Yeah, maybe you're right. You know, it's too bad we're such great buddies or we could make out with each other. - (chuckles) What? - Uh, nothing. Come on, pal! Let's run and be free. (chuckles nervously) Whoops! I tripped right into you! (giggles) That's right. - Everybody's havin' fun - Whoops! Whoa! (humming) (children laughing) What's that? Mnh-mnh! Hey, girl! Girl, I know you can hear me! Girl, get back to your hive! Quit hanging out with that bologna tube! - It's disgusting! - Mnh-mnh. Yo! Shut it! - She's an independent lady! - Yeah! Shut it! - A'ight! Hey! You guys want to roast a wiener? - Yeah! Gonna teach you to mind your b's and q's, chump! Buzzzzz! - Uh! Run, Breezy! Aah! - You're about to get - waggle-danced, you chicken! Unh! - Ow! Ooh! Oh, no! Flower! I mean Finn! (gasps) (clattering) Aha! Don't worry, Finn! - I jacked some royal jelly from their hive! - (groans) Breezy No! (gulping) (gasps) Uh Aaaah. (grunting) (vomits) - Hey, honeybuns! - (groans) Whoa! Oh, no! She got into our secret sauce, bro! It's all over! Long live the queen! (crashing) - Breezy? - Yes, Finn. Can't you see? I've become a queen to save you because I love your flower and and I think I love you! Now you can partake of my pollen crumbles and become my drone. Um You know, I'm I'm trying to keep it casual, B. I just don't feel the same way. - I don't feel anything. - But I royal-jellied for you. (sniffles) I'm lost in the darkness, Breezy. (dance music plays) Finn. Finn. I saw this already! I know all about your dirty deeds. Now it's lumpy's turn to slump - those lips! Bring it in, baby. - Wha? - Where you going? - That's it. We made out. Wha what?! I didn't wait infinity for a dip in the kiddie pool! - We're taking this to the deep end! - But I'm not a good swimmer. Don't be scared, Finn. Lumpy's on lifeguard duty. How's it going, guy? Is any of this helping? I'm gonna forget you did that. Right in the vault. (sighs)  My love will not fade, I see love beyond reason - What do I hear? Oh, so beautiful! - Blooming - This voiceless singing - Is this a dream? Oh, so magical! - My chest is full to burst! - This memory of feeling - Ahhhhhh! - Who calls to my heart? - Whoa! - Ahh ahh ahh! My hero arise - let love be your guide. - Whoa, whoa, whoooooa!  (gasps) - Yeah! Whoo-hoo! - What the lump? Oh, hey! - Finn, you got your arm back! - (laughing) Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Breezy (gasps)

Tree trunks! The slumber party's about to start! Get those hot buns in here, girl! Did you hear me? I said, get those hot unh! Hi, Mr. Pig. Why are you hitting me? I was just talking about tree trunks' hot Come on, Finn! We're doing music chairs. - Everyone ready? - Ready! Take a seat! There's a seat by me. You take it, Princess. This is your party. No, no, I insist. Time is up! You two must now be sent to the closest closet to have heavenly thoughts. Heavenly thoughts. - Hey, PB. - Hey, Finn. Mm? Bup, bup, bup Hey, you want to ditch the party and go for a walk? Wha really? It's been a while since we just hung out, you know? What about the candy people? Aw, they should be fine, right? For once? Maybe they'll surprise me by being fine. Come on. - Whoa! - Secret passage. Noice. Boy, it's sure quiet in there. What's going on in there, you think? Someone should listen at the door. We nominate you, Crunchy, to go listen at the door. And tell everybody what's going on. - What? Why me? - Come on, Crunchy. You're the go-to guy. You're the new Cinnamon Bun. No, I'm not What do you hear? Yeah, paint us a picture, Crunchy. I hear, like, uh like, a lush green field Next to a white picket fence. Finn and the princess both brought picnic baskets. Oh, but they brought the same stuff, and they' laughing about it. And now they're kissing. There's no lush green field in that closet! Well, you guys asked me to paint a picture. Just tell us what you hear! I can't hear anything. They must be just lightly brushing their lips together. Or maybe they kissed so much, they passed out! Crunchy, open that door! Step aside, Crunchy. I'll make short work of this door-opening. Oh. I guess I'm just too strong. Then they're trapped! What if they run out of air?! No air? I'll smash down the door! - Stop! - Eh? Mr. Cupcake, your mighty strength might kill them! There's a drill and saw in the supply room, though. - In here, you say? - No, don't! Aww. Yo, guys! You got to do something! That's my best friend in there! "You okay in there?" "Yeah, we went out the secret coat passage." It's so nice to get away sometimes. Mm. Candy peeps can be a handful, huh? Yeah, they mean well, though. You want to meet Timmy? Timmyyy! Aww, so squish! - Hop on. - Okay. Breathe! Breathe! - Breathe! - Wait. Wait! Don't candy people breathe out, like, a poisonous gas or something? Somethin' like, uh, c carbo - Carbon diox - I know! It's called  and it is deadly. Zuck it back out! Zuck it back out! Oh! Cupcake's dead! - What do we do?! - Ha! So, got any other weekend plans? Mm. Probably gonna hit up the arts and crafts kingdom with BMO. You? Oh, I'm gonna garden some, plan next week's pizza lunch, answer 800 e-mails, and, you know, whatever. Wowz. Do you ever get tired from doing princess work all the time? Sure. I mean, it's a lot of responsibility looking after so many people, though, lately, I have been trying to be more chill about it. Cool. Like taking ice-cream breaks? Yeah, and, like, being more Sort of okay with everyone making mistakes around me. Like, mind my own stuff more. You know what I mean? Yeah. Kind of like how I've been thinking about my dad and how I want him to act more like daddy. But maybe acting like daddy just isn't what he does. Maybe my dad's not a dad but a kid stuck in a dad's body. Timmy knows what's up. Timmyyy! Timmyyyy! Okeydokey, everybody. Check it out. Once in place, this sweater will muffle the cannonball explosion perfectly, allowing the frame around the door to gently fall apart, freeing Finn and PB. Manfried's a good leader because we can always see him. Now, the cannon should go right over here. Oh. Wait. Here. Aren't you worried about Finn? Of course I am. See these tears of worry? It will be okay, Jake. "PB is showing me al this cool stuff. She has an awesome shirt." "How's the party?" Awesome. Okay, everyone, prepare for the boom. Three - Two - Fire! Aw, my cannon. Uh-oh. Hey, the closet's open! So, they're dead, right? Well, Chocoberry can tell us! She saw a ghost at my house once. Oui, it's true. I have "ze gift." Hmmmmmm! Yes, I sense their spirits. Finn says he says Remember to feed BMO. Well, that idea stank, Manfried! - I'm calling the shots from now on! - No! Manfried is still the most clearly visible! Hey, why don't you guys team up and fight each other to see who gets to wear the crown? Here try this one. Mmm! Fire. You got a little - edible-fire mustache, there. - What?! Got to send this to Jake. Hmm. "Check it out." - Hey, what's that? - Uh, - uh, it's - Let me see. - Mm. - You won't like it but okay. I'll worry about it later. Oh. - You want to see the burrito room? - Yessss. This is a brutal new society. For a society to function, it needs rules. One, you must drink tea with your pizza. Two, pizza can only be eaten alone. Three, if a pizza is found in a field, you must make the next person you see holding a glass of milk eat it. Sire, I must congratulate you on becoming princess. - Thank you. - Is there anything I can do or get for you? - Anything? - Anything! Could you perhaps procure a pizza? Yesss. Man, this is intense. I better do something! Thanks for showing me around, PB. - I've enjoyed just hangin' out. - Me too! Jake just sent me a funny picture of himself. Whoa. It looks like the candy people's makeshift government has been taken over by a ruthless despot. What? - Why aren't you freaking out? - Eh, it was worth giving them a shot. Let's go back to the party, though. It looks like we have to save it. Neigh! Whinnie! Crun-chy! Crun-chy! Crun-chy! To the crater! Any last words, Starchy? You smell! Throw him in! What's going on here? Uh They devolved into beasts. - It was hilarious! - Okay. Everybody, get into your sleeping bags, and I'll read you a story. Modern menswear can be traced back 200 years.

Taste it, scrub! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! Man, I can't believe it. I got to weewee again. Would you like to rate this video? No time, BMO. Let's go find the cave from the video. Maybe we'll find more clues there. "Kee Oth zaple myrups pama mancakes." Whoa. Jake? Yeesh. Eh? Jake? Finn, yes! Help me! Jake! This is not hugging! It's fighting! Fighting! Jake, what do I do? Should I kill him? With what?! With this! Demon blood! That's right! Demon blood beats demon! Uh, that is not correct. Oh, yeah! Give me that blood, stupid! Whoaaaaaaa! Lady, don't break the circle of protection! Aw, geez. He's sucking my sword off its hilt! Yeah! Your circle can't stop my sucking! Now I have your demon blood, as well! Except it's not demon blood. It's a frozen grape juice that was blessed by the priest. Cold. Bless this sword, Fodder! Mm. Check, please! Mmm. Grapy. Wait. Aaaaaaaaaah! My blood! Whoo! Coward! Whoop! Hey, hey! Lady! Let's go, bros! Samantha, you can come, too, I guess. Very well. You've returned me to my world, so I recant my oath to destroy you. You made an oath? Okay. Let's fight again sometime. Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree. Hmm. Took long enough for you to stretch out of that pit. Psh! Please. Not even. Uh, because Kee Oth was right there! A-and there were traps. I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it. Jake?! Whew! Sorry. I got a little light-headed. I love you, too, Lady. Yo, guys. I still love Flame Princess. Okay, big hug. Hug!    This party is so crazy!


  Oh! Ha ha! I win! Oh. Hey, man. You and BMO play finger spread quietly. I need to get into the zone. I am ready to receive instruction from the realm of creation above me for the sandwich I am about to conceive. I am open. Use me. Rosemary, thyme. Sous-vide. Keep that at 135 degrees. All right, now we're getting somewhere. Cream cheese pickles from my boy Prismo and some dill! Diced boiled eggs! Bird from the window! Yeah, baby, now we're rolling! Whoo! Common cucumber! Sliced roma tomato. Sweet yellow onion, organic. Almost done. Tears for salt. Meat prepared sous-vide. Bacon. You're the most important part. Lobster soul. It's amazing. Ohh-oh. This is the greatest sandwich I've ever made. Is it glowing? You guys want some? It's cool, man. I know you want to eat the whole thing, and I'm cool with that. Thank you. Magic Man! Magic Dog! I'll take some sandwich. You stay away from my woman eh, my sandwich! Hmm, yeah, I could do that. Or wait. Wait. Sandwiche! Mijo! Magic Man! My sandwich! That's a good-looking sandwich. What are you gonna do with it? Something gross? It's got my germs, so it's mine now. N-o-o-o-o-o! Dead arms! Give it back, you animal! Look, if you really want your sandwich, you'll have to solve my little riddle. Unh! When your face shows 7:20, when green leaves turn brown, the only way forward is down. Then you'll see, the wetter, the better. That's not even a riddle. It's word play, at best! You try and come up with something on the spot! It's hard! Aah! Now to savor the moment. It's just you and me, baby. What the Jake, wait! What's he doin' in there? Why did he freeze himself with my sandwich? He's not frozen. He's super-slow-mozen, motion. Look. Aw! That's gross! Well, let's go grab it before he hits the ground, which is when I assume he'll take a bite. Yeah, okay. Hmm. Feels like cold spaghetti. Oh hey, Jake. Hey, Finn. How long have we been in here? I don't know. Retre-e-a-at! Whoa. How long were we in there? Five hours. Five hours?! He's halfway to hittin' the ground! Which is when he'll bite my sandwich, probably. Yes. BMO! I agree that is when he will probably take a bite. You're not helping. Oh. You need help? I can help. Processing. Must be his new software. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Ding! I have the solution, Jake. What?! BMO, are you serious? Yes, this plan will work. Yes! But we have to hurry. Yes! All right, BMO! Wait, wait, wait. BMO, are you just making a skateboard video? No, Finn. This is the plan. Are you sure? Jake, you will have your sandwich back before my board hits the ground. Okay, BMO. Yay, BMO! This is s-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i i- i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i He lied to me. Relax. I'm calling Princess Bubblegum. It's ringing. Maybe I should just make another one. Eh, okay. Let's do this. I can make another awesome sandwich. Creation realm, inspire me once again! Okay Thanks again for coming, Prubbles. Of course, Finn. Once you explained about Jake's sandwich, I had to. So, how's it looking? I'm picking up major levels here. Of magic? Molasses. Oh. He's using a molasses-based supercovalent subatomic bond, slowing down anything that enters its field, but only if the molasses is at room temperature. Mm, this one. My molasses warmer will get things moving. l- l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-I-I-I Well, I'm out of ideas. Who are you calling? Marceline. The Vampire Queen?! Oh. Maybe Maybe it's just as good! Blaagh! It's terrible! Dang you, Magic Man. You took my one and only! See, I think the molasses must be protected by some sort of chemical Oh, hey, Jake. How are you holding up? Not too well. BMO looks cool though. l- l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-I-I-I Don't be sad. Yeah, Marceline's got a great plan. Yeah, man! What's your plan? Demon juice! R-a-a-a-a-a-a-h! R-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a I- I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I Hey, man. What are you doing? I'm lighting these candles so I can move on with the grieving process. I made them with the leftover bacon fat from my sand I am not giving up. Let's see. Who should I call? Ice King? Shelby? Tree Trunks? Tree Trunks?! No, man, don't call Tree Trunks! What's she gonna do?! Bake an apple pie?! Don't you get it?! It's over. It's over, and I've never been so sad. And you know what? I got to deal with it. Jake, look! Hmm? What? But how? Because you've never been this sad! That's what magic man meant by your face showing 7:20, or as some people call it, a sad face. What? Nobody calls it th-a-a-a-a-at! Nope! No! Don't get judgmental. Stay sad. Right. Magic Man, I'm gonna sock you in the head! Ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha Jake, every time you get happy, you slow down! Stay sad, man! Make yourself sad! Uh okay! J-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ake! It's okay, Lady. You got to let go. He's gone now. Let me take you out for a coffee, get your mind off things. Hey, Lady, I'm here for you. Don't you ever forget that. Hey, Mr. Cupcake, you stay away from Lady! No, man! Stay sad! Make yourself sad! Uh I I love you, Jake. We should have hung out more. What? Um, I love you too, Mr. Cupcake. I didn't want to hang because I thought Lady was into your muscles. And I thought if we'd hung out, you'd sweet-talk her and take her from me. What? I would never. I have got so much respect for you. Dude, I have so much respect for you. I try to be like you in some aspects of my life. Look, if something were to happen to me, and I wasn't here anymore, I'd want you to take care of Lady and the kids. That means so much to me. I wish we had more time together. Me too! Yeah, Jake! The wetter, the better! Keep crying! I'm sorry, Mr. Cupcake! Unh! Oof! Hunh! Boardslide! Ah-haaaa! Yay! I got you, baby. Sandwich is so good!    This party is so crazy!


     Puppies! Puppies! Puppies! Hey, Jake. Hey, Lady. We came to see your new pups. Puppies!  Hey, dudes. They're still pretty sleepy. Sleepy little sweeties. Pups, meet everybody. - Yes! And this sweet little lady is Jake Jr. Aww! Oh. That's a butt. Pre-e-e-e-tty cute.  Finn I love all my little babies so much. I'm not gonna let anything happen to them.  Dude, real talk are you worried about being a dad?  No way. Check this out. Thanks, honey.  It's "Mom's Manual for Raising Beautiful Children." Aw, dude mom! She would have been so proud to see you and your pups.  BMO:  Look! Look!  Aw, BMO! When's the last time you washed your controller?  Ugh! Wh-o-o-o-o-o-oa!   We were just wrestling. Cool-uncle wrestling.  Uh l-l-I think it's getting kind of late. Um, puppies need sleep. Okay. Uh, Finn you should go home. I'm gonna live with Lady and the pups from now on. I'm a dad now. It's a pretty big whoop. Oh. Psst! Who wants to play video games?! Yeah, okay. I guess we'll take off. We'll hang out soon. Aw, no prob, Bob. Heh. Congrats again. I'll be right back. Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! I'm gonna be the best dad ever. Breakfast time. Sorry, honey. I'm on guard duty. You're sleeping for both of us tonight.  Breakfast ideas for pups. Recipe for French toast. Ingredients  Butter, three large eggs, a wide dash of vanilla, milk, 10 slices of bread white, brown, multigrain, or country loaf. In a large mixing bowl, crack the eggs and whisk the milk, vanilla, and Hmm.  all eggs and honey. When your consistency is satisfactory, set mixture aside. Dip bread into mixture and soak bread thoroughly. Ha ha! Kind of like a dead person. SautÃ© your eggsoaked bread slices until They're just asleep. It's okay. You got to be a tough  a tough dad. Aaaaaaaaah! The puppies aren't moving! Perform CPR! They might be dead!  Saved 'em. Mom's Manual knows best.  You guys are getting big. Okay. Excuse me. Mom's manual suggested I read you guys a story. This was your daddy's favorite book when he was cute, like you. Mm-hmm. Mm hmm. "There once were five little babies who were very cute and very chubby. One day, they met a fox. 'I'm so hungry that there must be something wrong with my stomach,' said the baby-eating fox. 'Will one of you babies be so kind as to look inside my belly and see what's wrong? ' 'We all will! ' Said the babies, who were as helpful as they were chubby." This is a lot darker than I remember! Um gimme a sec. Is this appropriate for babies?  Get that book out of here! Yeah, okay.  Sorry, sweeties. Mom's Manual says no.  Take them out for fresh air, huh? There there might be a giant fox out there. Or some some other predator.  Hey! - This is not for babies! Hey. Free book. H-Hey, everybody, look. Look at this book I found about eating babies. Huh? A book about eating babies? They just sit there while you eat them. Whoa! Eatin' babies. Wow. Why haven't we been eating babies this whole time?  I don't know, but I'm going to go eat one right now. Yeah! Let's eat some babies!  Okay, everyone, your mom wanted me to take y'all outside. Unh-unh-unh. Be careful.  No, Charlie. No! Too much germs, you know?  Everybody stick together and don't do anything. And we can all take a nap.  Then  Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaah! Oh, my gloob! No-o-o-o-o! N-o-o-o-o!! It's every parent's worst nightmare! No! No! No! Put that down! Get off of there! Aah! Come back!  Wait! T. V! You're gonna hurt yourself! Charlie, no! Viola, wait!  JAKE: Hey, Lady.  These puppies are really wearing me out, you know? I can hardly keep my eyes open.  No, no. It's it's all in the manual. You see, it's  It's  Is that a baby? He doesn't look right. Why is he so sweaty? And hairy? Look, fellas, there's never gonna be a perfect baby. Times like this, you just gotta dive right in. Coochie-coochie-coo!   What the What are you doing?! Let me go! Hold on. Hold on a minute.  Just just lemme  Y'all better watch out. Huh? Puppies? What are you doing?! Go back inside! The Manual's gonna flip! Dad, the manual's a bunch of junk! Just give us a chance! Jake Jr., you said your first words "The Manual's a bunch of junk!" The Manual's a bunch of junk?! Hmm. MANUAL: Ohh! Stay back, Jakey. My Manual says it's too dangerous. Mom, your manual's a bunch of junk! Look what I can do! Ha ha! Oh dear glob.  I'm sorry for being such a little stinker, kids. Come on and show the old man what you got.  Whoa! What the  W-W-W-W-Whoa! You see, Dad? We flippin' crushed it. Crushed it!  You did. I'm super-proud, y'all. And I'm duper-sorry, too. I've been trying to make you know about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did by not listening to my mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boom box.  Yup. I've been trying to make them know about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did by not listening to my mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boom box. BMO:  I said to the bread lady, "What happened to your husband? Is he bread? Is he bread? I've got all the bread you need"  Hey, guys. I'm back. Is everything okay? Did you ruin it? Nah, nah. It's cool. It turns out the pups can pretty much take care of themselves. They don't really need me around. - Oh. - Yeah. I guess Rainicorns age really fast. They're basically, like, older than me already. Kil Whan has a beard now. - Oh. - Ah, it's okay. I've got a slammin' family right here, too. Plus, all my stuff is here.

How'd you get the name Football, Football? BMO gave it to me. Is BMO your little papa? Uh, so where do you live, Football? - The mirror. - Oh, yeah? What's it like there? Cold. Empty. It's lonely. Weird. Very weird. Hello? Football, are you okay? It's weird in here. I'm not going back, BMO. Come closer, Football. I can't hear you. I'm not going back, BMO. I'm staying on this side Forever.

Did somebody say, "family meeting?" What's up, BMO? No, I'm not BMO. I'm Football. - Oh, yeah. - Hi, Football. Yes. Hello. I'm here, and I am Football. And I will always be Football. Because BMO told me to tell you that he has gone away forever. BMO. "Take my place, Football," is what he said. It was such a hard decision for him to make. He says for you guys to treat her I mean, me As nice as you treated him, BMO. We all need to stay strong, so the best thing everyone can do is forget about him. Remember, if you guys miss BMO, I miss him more. That's great, BMO. Football. Oh, right Football. Hey, Football. Grapefruit for your troubles? Uh Oh boy! Thanks! - Life is great! - Yeah? You sure you're doing okay, little pal? Mm. Listen, B Football. You seem like you might be feeling, uh, a little donked up in your head or your heart or both. And that's okay. Everybody feels some type of soul nausea like that sometimes. - Football. Football. - BMO? I know how to follow you, Football. How did you get in the spoon? I figured it out! I'm going to get you, Football! Did all that make sense? Yeah. Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! I'm going to get you, Football! Aah! Ha! Ha-ha! This is the way it has to be MO. Oh, my gosh!

All right, hand over the shillelagh, BMO. No! No! No! Hey, Jake, BMO went all hog wild in the bathroom. Gross! Not like that. Ohhh. Why you got to be so destructive today, BMO? Are you doing robot puberty or something? Jake! Jake, help me! Jake! All right, Football, you know what time it is. Sooner or later, you're going to slip on some spaghetti, and I will be waiting on that shiny floor to drag you into your worst nightmare. BMO, you've seen where I live. You know why I don't want to go back. But we made a deal, and where I come from A factory Breaking deals means you have to go to the dirt hole. That's where you are going, Football, if you don't switch places with me. No! You're going to the dirt hole, Football. Dirt hole! No! I'm going where you will never find me. Oh, Football! Football!

Yes, I'd love to! I've missed my traffic cone so much! Hooray!


     Time Is a slippery devil. Our lives are sudden. They come and go like Like a summer shower. Oh, my glob! You got the part!  I did? Well, not that part. You were terrible. But you can be my personal assistant. Well I guess I have to start somewhere. Start with my laundry. Tree Trunks: Our lives are sudden. They come and go like a summer shower. LSP: That was great! Well, maybe not "great," but you were a lot better than those others. - Hey! - Hey! - Hi, Viola. - Hi, Dad. How's my big-shot actress daughter? Did you get that part you wanted? Oh, yeah, the part Sure, I got the part. Well, I think that's great. Just great. Seriously, that's so good to hear. Sometimes I wonder if maybe I haven't been the best Dad. Maybe I blew it. But you getting that part, that makes my entire life seem worthwhile! Mmm. You're great, kid! Aww, you're great, Dad!  _ Dad, I have to go. I have a rehearsal. That's cool. Go get 'em, kid. Tree Trunks: I do hope that Nigel had no trouble at chelmsyhead station. There are never any taxi cabs to be found What have I found here?! Is it a little mouse? People, look what I found! It's a little mouse! Everyone else is really a square, working together as a team, helping the author/director. Everyone has the team spirit! Everyone except the selfish little mouse! I'm sorry, I was Don't interrupt me when I'm berating you! Mr. Cupcake:  When are we going to resume rehearsing? Don't interrupt me when I'm berating my assistant for interrupting me Unless you want some, too! Well, no. I can't remember what I was saying. Assistant, read me back my notes. Hmm. You were wrapping it up so we could get back to rehearsal. Okay Let's rehearse! Mr. Cramforth will be drenched if he walks to the cottage from the station. Poor suffering Nigel! Um LSP: "But he" But he is so awfully amusing.  Coming down like cats and dogs. Reminds me of the rain we had Too much water on the coat! It's not a hurricane! Again!  Coming down like cats and That's too light! It's not a drizzle! Hey, Viola!  Viola!  Here, girl!  Come on, I want to show you something.  I think it's gonna rain soon, so I'm gonna show you what real Summer Showers look like. And I want you to make little sketches of raindrops as reference material. Do you really think this is worthwhile? Yes! Gah! How can I explain this as simply as possible? In my play, I don't want to see big, big gloopy raindrops. And I don't want to see teeny-weeny, tiny raindrops. What I want to see is raindrops that are just right. Neither too big nor too Stop interrupting me when I'm trying to explain things childishly! Every element of "Summer Showers" has to have class. You know, I may be a princess, but when people meet me, they don't think "princess." They think "Lumpy Space Princess." I bet if I was "Princess Bubblegum Buns" or "Sugar Plum Buns Princess" or something, things would be way different. They have absolutely no imagination! I'm the one who has imagination! I'm the one who's special! I think my play will prove that  I've had a really crummy life. Everything was okay when I was a little kid. And I could just hang out by myself and make up little games. Have you tried talking about this with anyone else? No! It's part of your job! You're lucky, it's starting to rain. Now, pay close attention to these raindrops. You should fill the whole sketchbook! I want to see some classy raindrops on opening night!  Tree Trunks: It's so good to see you, Nigel. Let chelmsford take your overcoat. Very well, Tree Trunks. Her name is Miranda Hobson! I don't know if I can call Tree Trunks by that other name. It seems dishonest. This play is set in a country called Eng-land. And in Eng-land, anyone called Tree Trunks is always called "Miranda Hobson" during the summer. Mr. Cupcake: I didn't know that. Yeah. So let's whoa! How did you get here? I locked the d Never mind. Have you finally figured out what rain looks like? Let's take it from the top! Coming down like cats and dogs. Reminds me of the rain we had when mother was still alive. It'll have to do. Still lots to finish! Stay sharp! Keep it classy! Let's take it from act two!  How lovely you looked this afternoon, Tree Trunks Miranda! Miranda Hobson. Oh, Nigel! You've always made me smile, even when we met, as children at the badminton tournament. You were such a mischievous little boy And you still are. Mwah!  I admit I feel quite sleepy! The Summer Showers always did affect you that way. I'll let him rest. After all, the rain can't last forever. That wasn't too bad, actually.  Yes, hello. Miranda Hobson speaking. Yes, Ms. Hobson, you won't remember me, but my name is Wilfrid. We met in April at the Chestnut festival at St. Margaret's school. I'm between trains and I thought I might drop by. No visitors to bulkley cottage all season, and now two in one day! The doors open in an hour. Here's a pep talk. Tonight is your night to be special, 'cause you're in a pretty darn special play Written by me. Directed by a pretty special director also me. Hey, Viola! Yes, director LSP? Where's our leading lady? Oh, there you are! What's the matter? You look like you're going to throw up. I'm going to have to back out of the play. What?! When I told Mr. Pig about the kissing scene, he didn't take it well. Kissing scene?! Kissing scene?! Kissing scene! I'm dreadfully sorry. You can't do this to me! Who else knows all the lines?! Who else could possibly take your place at the 11th hour and be a big hero!?  Viola! Your excited gasp just gave me an idea! I'll play the part!  She sells seashells by the seashore. She sells seashells by the seashore.  Aah! I'm sorry!  Are you really here, or are you, like, an eye floater? I've been usurped! I can't believe this is our last summer here. But everything changes, I suppose. Oh, one thing hasn't changed You've never looked lovelier Miranda Hobson. I'll let him rest. After all, the rain can't last forever.  How long have we been sitting here on the couch, Wilfrid? Ages and ages. But not nearly long enough!  One looks for a little brightness to warm the days. I thought that Nigel Cramforth had that brightness. But now I see that doesn't matter. For you have a different kind of brightness A kindness that will always make the cold ham and bitter rain of Eng-land seem like hot tea, and sweet strawberry jam, and Summer Showers.  Whoo! Viola! That's my girl!  You were great, kid! Thanks, but it's not as if I wrote the play. That was  I should be mad But you were so amazing! She's quite the actress. What?! No, the acting was fine But the rain! It looked so real on the overcoats! How did you do it? This play is gonna run for 20 years! That was my job, actually Putting raindrops on the overcoats. I only went on stage as a last-minute replacement. You mean you did the special effects! You're amazing, kid! Aww You're amazing, Dad! You're amazing! You're amazing!


  The tree of blight. Every hundred years, it spews evil spores across the land. Then let's burn its butt down to the root-rubbings! Finn, I can feel a bunch of eyeballs peeping us from the woods. Hugs! What the is this an extra butt? Quick, Jake, burn the tree. Grr, hugs. Gonna catch you up, boy. I'm gonna sugar you to pieces. Dude! The tree's about to 'splode its evil juice all over. No! Ugh! Jake! Hurry! Is he crushing you, man? No, he's just hugging me gently. Oh. When you see the wicker devil in tree afterlife, tell him Jake says "Hello." Aah! Aah-ha-ha! Ugh. Hey, buddy. You okay? Didn't even tell me its name. What? Oh, sweet. Hot to the touch. Hmm. Dude, why are you so huggy? I just feel affectionate, I guess. Hugging helps. Mm. You got a fever, man. I feel hot. Finn, you're hurting me. I think you need a good night's sleep. You feeling better today? Yeah. I feel like a million clams. Good. Hey, you think we have enough candy litter? Litter for lunch! Mmm. Huh? Huh? Not again. What's the matter, Cinnamon Bun? Please, Finn. If you're gonna hug me again, don't make it as hard as you hugged me last night. Uh, I didn't hug you last night. Yes, you did. My love handles still hurt. You came into my room around midnight and gave me a squeeze a really strong one! C. B. Says I hugged him. Cinnamon Bun, you've got some crazy notions. I tell you. Oh, Cinnamon Bun. What a crazy story, buddy. Yeah, buddy. But you were pretty huggy last night, buddy. Wait. You don't think I actually snuck into Cinnamon Bun's room and hugged him, do you? I'm just saying, you were really clingy. But no. Why would I? And don't tell me it's because I have repressed emotional feelings for Cinnamon Bun. No. I have a theory, but I don't like it. Your questionable behavior started about an hour or so after you got hugged by that wolf-man, right? So? Well, I've been thinking that maybe that wolf-man wasn't what he seemed. Maybe he was some sort of "Hug Wolf." Yeah, here it is. Hug-Wolves "A subset of wolf-men which roam the countryside with a fervid hug-lust. Every night, hug-wolves must go out and hug people to satisfy their insatiable craving for hugs. To become a hug wolf, one must be hugged by an alpha hug wolf on the night of a full moon! Like last night! Yes. So you must be a beta hug wolf a lower-level creature. Well, how can I get un-cursed? Let me, um, read the book a little more. It says there's no known cure. I'm scared, Jake. No hugs! I'm sorry. I feel hot. What's wrong, Beemo? I'm terrified of Finn. Hmm. Well, that plant's not gonna protect you. You can get this under control, buddy. Are you ready to overcome this thing?! I think so. I said, "Are you ready to overcome this thing?!" Yeah. I heard you. I said, "I think so." I'm trying to get you to shout. Oh. Okay. Is this good?! Never mind. Now, I want you to think about hugging a cactus. How would that feel? Prickly and painful. Good. Good. You're doing great. Cool. So, can I hug the cactus now? No, you can't hug anything. But that poor cactus. It it needs me! Ah, no. The hug-lust has already taken over your brain. I want to hug you, Jake. Finn? Say something to reassure me. I'll hug your mom. Jake, we need the silver baseball. Hugs. Hugs. Hugs. Hugs for buddies! Oh, glob, oh my glob, Jake. Mama! Bring it in, guys. Scream-o! Beemo! Strobe-light mode! Not cool. Back, beast. Surely this frosted drink will soothe my fevered tempers. Hello? Good heavens. A lycanthrope! Aah! Hug you up, bro. Dracula? Aah! Eee! Hugs! Get away from my daughter, you hairy teenager! Eee! She'll never marry! Finn? Finn? There he is. Huh? Huh? What what happened? Jake, what happened to me last night? You hugged everyone. No! There he is! We're mad, but we're not gonna go down there. People of the Candy Kingdom, all I've ever wanted was to keep you all safe. And because I can't undo the hugs I've caused, my sole wish is to be locked up forever in the Candy dungeon. Why is Finn in a cage, mama? Isn't hugs nice? Oh, baby. Candy people! Let's make sure that alpha hug wolf pays for what he's done. Yeah! Yeah! I agree with the last guy. Cinnamon Bun, you watch over Finn. Uh Let's go, boys. Uhh but but but No more hugs! No more hugs! No more hugs! Without consent. Huh? Hugs!! Finn? Uh Cinnamon Bun, let me out. I I'm not supposed to. Don't you want a hug? I can't, man. Not even a little one? You want a hug? Yes! Hug me! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Which way does it turn? Ow! Ow, my sides. Say "No" to hugs! I smell someone being hugged right now! Uh, I have a wife. That hug be your last, demon. Still love you. Raah! Come here, baby. No huggies! Raah. Eh. Finn? I've failed you. I'm gonna hug you up. You call that a hug? This is the biggest hug that's ever existed. Yeah. Huh? You you stopped hugging me. Yeah. You stopped, too. I just didn't feel like I needed any more hugs. Me neither. The curse is broken! Can I get a hug? Jake! Mm. Aah!    This party is so crazy!


    Last chance, Swamp Giant. Tell us where you hid the Miniqueen. Never! ALL: Huh?  Hi, Miniqueen. Jake, l've got her! Then hold my hand, dude.  My inflatable Angel.  How's the Miniqueen?  l don't know. Can't understand a word she says. Aww. My pleasure, ma'am. l just like beating up evil.  - Okay. Didn't catch any of that either. Miniqueen must have stepped in something funky.  No, it's not tiny feet l'm smelling. This way! Whoa! What? Do you know whose sword this is? This is the sword of Billy! Billy?! BOTH:  Billy  Nothung!  Who's the greatest warrior ever A hero of renown Who slayed an evil ocean Who cast the lich King down? Billy! And that time the evil firecount Captured a damsel fair Who saved her with such bravery That she offered him her hair? Billy! Also, he fought a bear  Oh, yeah, that was the most mathematical thing ever! Yeah, he fought a bear. This is so cool. BOTH: Whoa! lt's Billy's legendary crack.  Uh, hello. lt's him, it's him! l know, l know. Be cool. Yeah, it's me. Man, l'm such a huge nerd for you. Please take us on as hero apprentices. What for? So that we can learn to kick evil's butt, just like you. l want to be the dog version of you. Aw, that would be a waste of time.  Yeah. l'm a little paunchy. But l could do some sit-ups. No, l was talking about beating up monsters. lt's as pointless as a dog chasing his own tail.  See, that's where you're wrong, 'cause watch. Ah, ah, ah. What do you mean, pointless? We just saved the Miniqueen from a monster. Do you know where she is right now? She's probably being eaten by a different monster. She's probably dead.  ln my youth, l was much like you -- motivated, headstrong, wore a silly little outfit. Even had a matching dog. l'm gonna pass out. All my life, l've beaten on evil creatures.  But new evil keeps popping up. Kicking their butts was a hopeless effort. What other way is there? Nonviolently. Help people by being active in your community. Nonviolently?  l got to try being nonviolent. The Billy way! Me, too! Billy, l won't let you down. l love you, Billy! l got a secret crush on you, Billy!  Pbht! This is gonna be tough, Jake. l'll have to suppress my every warrior instinct. Relax. lt'll be easy not to beat up on monsters and still help people. Help! Help! A monster!  Ohh! Aah! Oh, thank goodness -- heroes. l'm being chased by a horrible dragon! Please, please, help! Oh, uh Oh. Act quickly! He's almost upon us! Sorry, we don't beat stuff up anymore. No, but, please!  Dude, we got to do something to help him. l could teach him how to not be such a spaz. Hey, Mister, besides being chased by a monster, what else is wrong? Well, l've been running all day. l guess l'm pretty hungry. Say no more! Come on, Finn. Where are you going?! To make you something to eat! Aah! No! Help! l still feel weird about not fighting off that dragon. Trust me, this is a way better way to help him. Gruel! Get your free gruel! What's this all about? Free gruel, ma'am. l can't beat monster butts, but l can beat your hungry guts. That's for sure. l didn't throw up. This gruel is very adequate. Yeah!  This is great, Jake! Yeah, we're really helping people. Whoa, look who it is. Dude, you're alive! No thanks to you two! That dragon chased me for two days! And then l was lost for, uh, three days, and then l fell under a spell of a beautiful enchantress for, uh, a week? So that's two plus three plus a week -- Shh. Dude, gruel. Oh, thank you.   Hmm? Aah! What's happening?! Huh? Oh, that's probably the stone-skin potion l added to the recipe. lt gives your body the power to grow armor. What? Uh? Oh! Aah! Dude, how much of that potion did you use?  Aah! My tummy is breathing fire! Geez, l thought people would like that. Why?! Why would anyone want that?! So you can defend against evil monsters! You're supposed to beat up monsters so we don't have to defend ourselves! No, see, l'm helping you nonviolently. Helping?! l can't even move my hands! l'm a Cobbler! How am l supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts?! So, the village needs the help of a new cobbler, eh? BOTH: Hmm. What?! No! All right, we're cobblers! No, you're not! You're just watching my shop while l go to the dermatologist! And don't try to cobble anything! What does ''Cobble'' mean, anyway? l think it has something to do with shoes. Excuse me. Can you help me? l need a broken heel fixed. l'm going to a fancy funeral. Of course l'll help! There! Hwah! Pkow! Ah! Now you can fight off evil if it shows up at the funeral. You fix that shoe with a magic nail? Maybe. Whoa! Cool! l cannot go to the funeral in these! Hey, everyone! l'm back from the doctor! Uh, why?! And l'm not supposed to bring a guest! Get out! Apparently, l suck at being nonviolent. Dude, sucking at something is the first step towards being sort of good at something. You and l are like little baby Billys right now, and we're ''sucking'' on our first bottle of nonviolent milk.  Totes. l'll stop ''Pooping my diaper.'' Whoa, what?! Help! l need medical help! Medical help? Hmm. How can we help? l want surgery to make my body hot. Yikes. Yeah, l know l'm already pretty smokin', but l bought this swimsuit, so l need a swimsuit body.  You up for some serious plastic surgery? Oh, yeah, this bod is hot and powerful! Huh? Oh, what. Whoa! Aah! Dude, did you use a magic nail again? l've got three left!  What did you do to me?! We transformed you into a cyborg fighter! That's hot, right? No one thinks this look is hot! Oh, my laces, you're the most beautiful -- aah!  - Jake? - Yeah? l think us not being violent is hurting people. Man, Billy is gonna be so bummed out. Not if we run away, Finn. We'll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals, but we'll survive. l just want to sit here and moan. Then l'll moan with you, buddy.  Thanks, buddy.  You're welcome. Aah! Aah! Help me!  Relax!  l'm just gonna grlnd you up!  Oh, man, this grass bag again?! Hey, evil-doer, um, can you keep your evil-doing quiet? Finn is dealing with some heavy stuff over here. lt's not evil! When they get this old, they want to be ground up!  Right, you old bat? - Help! - Right?!  Huh? A fist raised in righteous anger? Oh, no, it's my fist! l've got to think of a way to save this old lady without punching this guy in the face! Hmm. Yeah, you want to get ground up, right?! - Wrong! - Ow! l couldn't think of anything.  Poop! l saved her with violence! What's your huff, son? The greatest hero in the world told me to help people without being violent, and l promised l would do that and not let him down. But l did let him down. Stuff and nonsense! You sure helped this old gal out, and you did it wlth violence. Like a true hero, you were born to punch evil creatures. Ohh! Just like l was born to be an old lady. Don't deny your rowdy nature, Paladins.  And don't take advice from old people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! That old lady has a point! Wait, didn't she say not to take advice from old p-- lt's all so clear to me! Back to the cave of Billy! Yeah! lt's us again! And we've got exciting news! l don't -- l don't want to buy anything! Billy, an old lady told me that l shouldn't listen to you because you're old -- also, that l should do what l was born to do, which is kicking buns. Don't you see how pointless it is? You know what's probably happening to that old lady right now? She's probably dead! She's right here. Hello!  We saved her, Billy. You saved her. l saved her, Billy. l saved her using violence, and that's not a bad thing, Billy. This old lady is alive because of these! And look how happy she is, man. She's elated! Hmm, perhaps you're right. Oh! Oh! Ugh! lt's -- it's as if your words are filling a void in my very being. You want to watch?  Whoa! Nothung! Finn and Jake, truly, you are my heroes.  Now you're freaking me out.  We're his heroes!  Huh. Hello.  l love you, Billy! Get out of here! 


     Hey, Jake? Yeah? You ever wonder what a demon's heart looks like? Of course, dude. You ever wonder what a demon's heart tastes like? EVlL VOlCE: Hey, kid, you want some magic powers? Magic powers for absolutely free. Heck yeah! Wait! Let's not be too rash. Just look at this guy. Check out the sunken, lifeless eyes, the foul stench of decay. You know what that means? lt means he's evil, l guess. Well, evil, sure, but mostly, he's unattractive, and unattractive people are desperate. You should haggle with him. Hey, l want more than just free powers. What else you got? All right. Free magical powers and  and this keychain. Oh, oh, oh! Play it cool, Finn. Right. l begrudgingly accept your offer. Yes! Then the deal is struck.  You can pick up your powers right through that door. This way.  This place looks magical. You think this is where we get the powers? Yes, l do. Free powers for all. Want some? Yeah! Are you the guy handing them out? You seek Bufo the Wizard. So, where is that guy? He is here, of course. Uh He's here? But he's not you? That's right. We should beat him up until he starts making sense.  ALL: We are Bufo. Oh! ALL: So So ALL: you wish to be inducted into the ancient -- ancient order -- Dang it, Leonard. lf we don't talk at the same time, nobody can understand us. Sorry. Geez. ALL: Ahem! So, you want free wizard powers, powers likethese!  Yeah! Yeah! BOTH: We want them. Give us the stuff. - Yes, we do. - Can't wait. ALL: Then follow me. BOTH: Whoo-hoo! ALL: Behold the grand hall of wizardry. This is where young potentials train to become ultimate wizards. But most are not ready for the responsibility that comes with it. l'm responsible, dude. So am l. That's a lie. lt is a lie. And l take full responsibility for it. ALL: Yes, yes, very responsible. Now l bestow upon you these wizard cloaks! BOTH: Whoa! Hey, this is a dress. Yeah. And l am into it. lt's like gossamer.  This way, l won't be embarrassed. ALL: Fine, fine. Now, for every power that you accrue, you shall receive a star badge like these. This final star betokens the rank of ultimate wizard. BOTH: Whoa! Mark me, Jake. l shall have that final star. Where do we start? ALL: Level 1 -- Dustomancy. Yeah! Dustomancy, whatever that is. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! ALL: To receive this power, you must first eat these brooms.  All right.  Wait.  This is gross. Man, l can't eat this. Yeah, you can. Do what l do.  Ahh! Oops. Ah, there we go.  Whoa, you got a star.  Observe my magics. Wait, Jake. Don't use them until l finish my broom. Lastbite.  Dude, you got your star, too. We're Dustomancers!  Nothing happened. This is a total rip-off. Bufo, you tricked us. Stupid power doesn't even work. ALL: Calm yourself, boy. You are acting hysterical. Do you not see that you are using Dustomancy? Behold. l'm doing this? So l have -- ALL: Yes! Mastery over all dust motes. You can also read their emotions. For instance, this mote is very unhappy in his marriage. That'ssort of cool. Sort of cool? This is radical! Whoo, yeah! Force that enthusiasm. ALL: Are you ready for more magic? We get more? ALL: So much more. Like level 2 -- the power of shadowcery. You can't see through those, right? Nope, not at all. ALL: To gain provenance over the shadows, place your hands into this bowl. What bowl? ALL: No! Cover your eyes!  Fine. ALL: Thrust your hands into this bowlof eyeballs. Eyeballs?! Dude, it's okay. They're just peeled grapes. ALL: No! They're eyeballs.  Yuck! ALL: Well done. You have groped the eyeballs fearlessly. Another star! Yeah! Shadowcery.  Onward, my shadow steed. Huh? No touchies. Wizard powers are so cool. l want all the star badges! ALL: Excellent. ALL: Well done.   All we're missing now is the big star. You ready to complete the set, man? Nah, l'm good. What?! How can you stop now? Eh, l got everything l need -- a limitless supply of mayonnaise, this captivating new hairstyle, and l just learned the best spell of all. What's that? Sleep.  Aw, what a lame-o. Bufo, l'm ready to get that big star. ALL: To tell true, the last power is not free. Wha? You can't do this to me, man. l've got no money. ALL: No. No cash. For the final star, you must takethe pledge of ultimate responsibility. Okay, l'll take that pledge. ALL: Are you sure? Perhaps you are not sufficiently familiar with -- l'm ready. ALL: Well, there may be ramifications that you cannot -- just let me take that pledge, man! ALL: My word, l've never met someone so irresponsibly responsible. Very well, then. You mustgraspmy hand. That's it? Easy. Whoa!  Huh?  My big star! Yes! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Wait. Where am l? ALL: Direct your attention to the scale-model orb. Huh? ls that an asteroid heading for this very temple? ALL: Yes. lt's been heading for this temple for 847 years. Only the magic of the ultimate wizards keeps it from getting any closer. Quickly, add your power to that of the orb. Oh, okay. Whoa! l got it. Now what? ALL: Now l release the elder Jeremy from his pledge. Razzamafoo! lt's about time. ALL: And you take his place for the rest of your natural life. Awesome. Wait. What? ALL: This is what you signed up for when you took the pledge of ultimate responsibility. This is what all the wizard training was about? You tricked me! Young wizard! The asteroid approaches. Oh, yeah, sorry.  ALL: l tricked you, of course, but would anyone ever volunteer to do this? l'm out. Aw, man, this sucks.  Old people, there's got to be a better way. Nope. This is how the ancient ones wanted it. Yeah? l got a younger idea.  You fool! Your newfangled thinking will get us all killed! Youth culture forever! Whoa! ALL: Hey, have you gone crazy? Get back in the bouncy harness. Sleep. ALL: You are -- Ultimate wizardry, activate! Uhhmm. Maybe my footing's off? There you go. l cast dragon eyes tiger claw vorpal hand blazing feet beauteous wings and finally, every other power l didn't mention by name! With all my magics combined, l'm powerful enough to move the entire village out of the asteroid's path.   l need some help. Jake, awaken! Reflect. Hey, l'm alive. What's that up there?  Oh, no! Aw, my stupid young idea will be responsible for hundreds of deaths. lt sure will. Huh? Old wizards, you ditched your responsibilities to help me. What?! No! We left so we wouldn't be killed by that asteroid. Oh, okay. Um, since you're here already, can you lend me a hand?   Huh? Whoo-hoo! Nice job. Thanks to us, the village is saved, and we reclaimed a few of your twilight years. ALL: Don't forget to thank me, for this was my plan for all of these 847 years. No way. Your plan was to dupe a succession of rubes into keeping the asteroid at bay. ALL: Perhaps you're right. No more giving out free powers. l hereby renounce all magic.  My life is over!! Chill, man. You don't have to quit your job. ALL: l don't? Nah, just don't take credit for ideas that aren't yours. ALL: Oh. Okay. Good idea. Glad l thought of it. EVlL VOlCE: Hey, naked kid, you want some freedemon heart? Full circle!

For when you awake, the pranking demon will be upon you! Aw, man! Nothing's better than throwing a big bag of butter at someone!  Gotta think! What's a better prank than butter? Answer me, book. What's better than butter? A unicorn a treasure hunter a battleship a pie a young girl in lo-- Wait! Book, rewind! That's it! l'll throw never-ending pies at Jake's face forever! l'm gonna build me a pie-throwing robot that throws never-ending pi-i-i-es on Jake's ugly fa-a-a-ce and he won't know what hit him 'cause the pies are ne-ne-ne-never ne-ne-ne-never ne-ne-ne-never-ending  lt's never-ending-pie-throwing time! Come on, dude! Turn on! Why isn't it working?!  l'll never make a prank better than Jake's garbage bag full of butter.  ROBOT: Ouch! Holy stuff! lt talked! Wow cow chow! Greetings, Creator. Oh, whoa! Hey, man! My name is NEPTR, which stands for ''never-ending-pie-throwing robot.'' Oh, perfect. You're exactly the kind of robot l was trying to make. Creator, l am eager to commence the creation and propulsion of pies forever. But my pie-hucking appendage is  malfunctioning. And my oven lamp is cold. And my tank treads do not roll! They only do skids! Why, Creator? -  Does it please you to watch me struggle? NEPTR, don't say stuff like that. Look, l know we just met, and you're probably going through a lot of personal stuff right now, but l really like you, NEPTR. And l'm not gonna rest until you're working properly and throwing hot pie at my best friend's face. Together, we're going to prank the poots out of Jake. Ha ha. l'll always love you, Creator. l know you will, NEPTR. Now, all we need is more lightning power so you can be operating at full capacity. And l think l know just the dumb-hole who we can get some from. NEPTR: Ooh! What beautiful piles of sugar!  No, NEPTR. We call that ''snow.''  Did y'all smack me into that mountain on purpose? ALL: Yeah! Take note, NEPTR -- these guys are grade-A pranksters. You guys hang out in case we need a daring escape. Yeah, sure. Daring escape, yeah. Absolutely. We got your back. l got his wallet.  Just got to sneak around until we find his lightning-bolt stash. But, Creator, is not breaking and entering wrong? No, we're pranklng and entering, which is awesome. Sneaking We're sneaking. Shush, NEPTR! - Sneaking - Shh! Sneaking NEPTR, you're gonna get us caught! - Sneaking! - ls that you, honey? How was your day at work?  Terrible! How could l possibly stand to be apart from you, the lce King?  You see, Gunter, that's how it would go if l actually had a wife. - Quack! - Game time! Kill the frog! Kill the frog! Ah, come on! Oh, he's right in front of you! Lower!  Stupid lady! Kill it! Creator, if we get caught, l want you to know that l will always love you. Shh! You already told me that. And we're not getting caught. We're gonna get you working so we can prank Jake. He could wake up from his nap at any second!  l might wake up at any moment! Nah, l'm still asleep. Oh, no! That frog is casting magic missiles on my babe!  Quickly, while he's distracted. Oh, come on! Get out of the--  Move! Quack! Bah! This game cheats anyway! Huh?! Look what you did, Gunter!  We're home-free, NEPTR.  What are you on about?  You're starting to infuriate me. Quack! Quack! lt's almost like you're trying to alert me, warn me about -- l don't know -- an intruder or something. Perhaps he's lurking in this very room, just outside my field of vision. -  - Well, knock it off! What do we do, Creator? We're gonna prank him, NEPTR -- hard-core. Ah.  You're looking kind of fat, Gunter. Look at these arms -- fat, fat, fat. Daddy's little fatty. Oh, you'll never get a prom date with all that tub on your face, you know. Oh! Cold! Blast these melty ceilings!  Creator, you have shown me the joys of pranking. l cannot wait to throw pies infinitely at Jake's face.  The ceiling really ls melty. Whoa! - Quack! Quack! What was that? Aaaaaaah!  BOTH: Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Figs! - Alarm! Alarm! - Huh? lntruder! Maybe a beautiful princess, like in my poems. Whoa! We got to find that lightning as fast as -- Creator! Lightning! lt's a lightning-shaped door! And we're gonna smash right into it! Hold on, NEPTR. l got a plan. Whoa! That was a great plan. Nah, that wasn't my plan. We got lucky. Are those my tickets to the gun show, Creator? FlNN: Mm-hmm. You're gonna be fully functional, just like l promised.  Whoa, ice-o-pede! Ohh! Finn?! Ugh! Why can't you ever be a princess?! lce-o-pede, attack! lce-o-pede, no! Aah! Let's grab some lightning and get out of here!  Finish him off, my semi-loyal pet! Wah! Aah! Look -- an innocent bystander! Zap! - NEPTR, n-o-o-o-o-o-o!  NEPTR is fully functional! Yay! Ha ha ha! NEPTR! Yeah! Crush him! Crush him like you crushed me! Creator? NEPTR, the pies! Pies! Oh, right.  Aw, come on! What was in those pies? Just boysenberries.  And also polson. NEPTR is acting different. ALL: Quick, Finn! Jump!  Wah! - You guys got me. Something about that robot l tried to kill fills me with deep longing. Thanks, guys. Your blood oath is fulfilled. ALL: Yay! To the mesosphere! Finally, we can die! l am troubled, Creator -- troubled by a sudden urge to collect princesses. NEPTR, that's a heavy unsettling thing to say. But pull yourself together! We're about to prank Jake! Uh-huh. Sure. One two Three! - Run, NEPTR! - Ooooh! Hah! Hah! Hah! - Zap! - Aw, man. l've come to take my son. - Your son?! - Come to pappy, son. l won't attack you, unless provoked. He's not your son! lf anything, he's my son! lt was my power that activated his full potential. Bzzz! Ooh! When you were struck with my lightning, you also became infused with my private particles. He wants to be with me, Finn! No way! NEPTR wants to help me prank Jake! l am torn. l am processing a love for both princesses and pranking. Don't worry, son. l'll show you the life you deserve.  No! NEPTR! Now that we've entered my imagination zone, allow me to tantalize you with thls!  Princesses! As my son, you will carry on the tradition of capturing ladies. Tell me more, pappy. No, NEPTR! l want a son who can do better than l, one who can succeed where l. have failed. You can mate with robot princesses! Can l still prank with Finn after? No! l'll show you what will happen if you hang out with Finn!  BOTH: Yeah! Pootin' on NEPTR to the max! Ha ha. Yeah, l love Finn's pranks! Who do you choose?! Come on, NEPTR. Choose me, buddy. Choose pranks. l uh, l choose lce King! What?! You've got to be flippin' kidding me! He made his choice. Get over it, crybaby. l'm not finished. l choose lce King to prank -- hard-core! What?! Agh! My face!  l birthed you, and l can unblrth you! - Never! - Unh! Sleep well, pappy, in your imagination zone full of beautiful princesses. You want to prank Jake? lt's why l was created.  Okay, let's g-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! Jake! Wake up! JAKE: Ah, hey, du-- Aah!  Sun is going down. Shall we capture princesses now, pappy? No, let's just stay here a little longer, son. l love you forever, pappy.  


  _ Raaaah! Raaah! Come on! Get ready, toids! Raaah! I'm mean as a bus, and I'm mad as rocks! Gumball guardians! There's an enemy at the gates! I'm an all-you-can-eat maniac! Whoops! Aw, come on! Ooh, ooh, ooh! Whoopee! Thank you, little candies. Thank you. You warm the wax heart of this poor King of Ooo! Now, I hear you asking, "King of Ooo, how can you be so wise?" I'll tell you how. Did you know that I am 8,000 years old? Could be. It's true. I'm that wonderful. Now, Princess Bubblegum she says she hasn't gone rogue. She says she's not a wild dog thirsty for blood. She says she's not a literal baby masquerading as an adult woman. She says a lot of things. Princess Bubblegum, you don't make sense! This guy's really working on me. Ennnh Yes, dear? Do you have something to say? Mm-hmm. I'm James' mother, Mrs. James. My son got turned into a mutant mass and was exiled to the Badlands by Princess Bubblegum. Trehh! Boo. Who isn't mad about their mutant children? What about Sweet P, King of Ooo? You threatened to burn down his mama's orchard. I did. That is true. Sweet P, I was like a cornered animal. "I knew no' what thy doone." I'm sorry, Sweet P. Here. Psst give me a kiss. Do you hear us, Princess Bubblegum? Do you hear us?! Shhhhhhhhut up. Princess, I'm sorry to disturb you, but I feel that you must campaign. The candy people are real dumb. I'm studying something that could be real important. Dah! This dumb election. It's not even I mean, it's barely even Barely even legal. "A barely and yet fully legal election" That's what my campaign manager told me. Let's hear it for him Mr. X! Weird, right? And even being legal, I mean, I made everyone. I made their homes. The candy people are mercurial, but they're not dillweeds. And this definitely legal election is in the jam-covered fingers of you, the people The candies. So, go. Vote with your hearts. Vote with your minds. Vote for the candidate who's not a teenage gum-golem. I mean, they know that I love them. And the votes are in. King of Ooo is our new princess. Hey, hey! What?! Whaaaaat?! You dillweeds! You're a dillweed, you're a dillweed's secretary, and you're probably some dillweed I've never met! You're three dillweeds being dillweeds, and you're going to dillweed this place into the ground! And you Princess! Princess! I don't know what a dillweed is. Hey, PB, what's the plan? We pledged our allegiance to you. Your allegiance is to the kingdom. Dudes, I don't know. I don't know when I'll be back in charge If I'll be back in charge. I need you both to stick around here and make sure the candy people are safe, even if it means working for a wad. "Auf wiedersehen, meine champions." Mwah. Mwah.  There's a new golden and waxy mornin' Good times a-comin' You've got your warning There's cheap healthcare, the workcamp's there The general tone is laissez-faire I'm a princess, I'm a princess I'm a priiiinceeeess  What's up, Peps? It's stuck. Ho, no, no, no, no! It's okay, everyone. It's okay. Close your eyes and repeat your safety mantra Hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie - Princess? - Huh? Oh. Sorry, Peps. I'm just so used to having my citizens around to protect. This is gonna take some getting used to. Permission to speak freely, ma'am? Granted. This horrible dump does not meet the level of fancy to which I have become accustomed. Noted. Also, FYI My uncle Gumbald built this cabin with his bare hands. I spent my summers here when I was younger. Anyway, it'll probably take a really long time for the candy people to realize a bad ruler is worse than a good ruler. Plenty of time to spruce this place up. Whew! Starchy thought life would be better under the King of Ooo, but now there's even more stuff to sweep. Poor old Starchy. Always getting the sweaty end of the lollipop. Hey, Starchy. What are you doing Sweeping? Oh, uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Suh-wee-ee-eepin'. - Yeah. - Mm. Hey, is it me, or is getting purpler out here? Oh, yeah. I think that's the catalyst comet. Guess it's getting pretty close or whatever. Getting close? Should we evacuate or What? No, no. It's cool, I think. It's just here to, like, shake things up, you know? It's okay. We've got sort of a a relationship. C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-comet?! Oh, Starchy don't feel good about this. - Starch? - Eht. Starchy's mind is burdened. Oh, Mrs. Gumdrop! He's coming. The comet it's gonna snuff out all life as we know it. What?! Oh, good Glob! Shouldn't we try and calm them down? Ehh, not after that whole "knock my tower over onto the castle" thing. A lot of guys got smooshed. They need to hear it from someone they really trust. - King of Ooo! - King of Ooo! - King of Ooo? - King of Ooo? King of Ooo? Wait, are you saying "King of Ooo"? What are you saying? I thought it was "kinkoff goo." Hey. You hear that? Downstairs. King of Ooo? King of Ooo? King of Ooo! What the It's that guy from before. He's mucking around with PB's ship Added all kinds of engines to it. Hey! Hey, what do you think you're doing? PB don't let nobody touch her stuff Not even me, and I'm cool Least of all you, you sauce-tasting Brian-sniffer whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Yeeh! Yeeh! Whoa! Uhhh! No mercy, Jake. Aaaaah! Hey, I'm back What the bing bong ping pong?! Gunther?! What the king kong sing song?! Whoaaaa oof! Sayonara, suckers! Uhh Ugh! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Oww! Aaaaah! Toronto, I've been princess for four hours, and society has already totally collapsed. Plus, now the sky is falling, I guess. Is this possibly somehow my fault? Pbbt! No way! Okay, look. Without your calming presence and selfless leadership, this situation would have been a hundred times worse. History will remember you as Ooo's greatest hero. As always, the voice of reason. Once again, my saintly nature has compelled me, unthinking, to assume the burdens of others. But a true justice demands a true accounting. And truly this is all Bubblegum's fa-aa-aa-ault! Oof! Good Glob! What no-o-o-o-o-w? Looking good, Peps. Man, this feels kind of good, right? It's like we're building a whole new kingdom from scratch, only without all my beloved citizens this time. And their dull, pleading chicken eyes. Maybe the King of Ooo could hold down the fort for a little while. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? Anyway, I'm gonna get some fresh air. B.R.B. What the Why's it so purple outsid What the Why's it so purple outsi What? It's too smoky to see. Oh! Something's peeking. Someone's jacking your spaceship! That is my ship! But it looks like it's been modded out. That much engine power It'll break through the atmosphere before I can do anything to stop it. Finn and Jake! Yeah! Get that guy! Oof! My Thorn. I think we should go inside. Oof! Gunther! What are you doing?! What am I doing? A fog shrouds my true intent even from myself. There! The catalyst comet. It all becomes clear. I am more than Gunther. Like a mighty chrysalis pushing out of a damp cocoon, I emerge! Jake! You okay? Yeah, man. Just don't croak out here. Hey, man, look at Gunther. Behold! I am Orgalorg! Whoa. That's pretty. Looks good, right? Hey, where's Glob? I don't know. Um, he exploded in space. Yeah, thought so. Man, are you still Gunther? 'Cause you seem like you're not. I'm Orgalorg. Well, what the heck are you doing, Orgalorg? It was just time to come out again. Glob K.O.-Ing himself, the arrival of the catalyst comet, and a ship to carry me out of this planet's gravity These are doorways the universe presented to me. Oh, I know about open-door philosophy. What's that? You just say yes to stuff all the time? Pretty much. That seems all right. It's all yours, if you're willing to take it. Destroy worlds, crush anyone blocking the door. Feel their bones crumple and their goo spill out. I don't like that at all. He made it ugly. You can't stop me. I'm Orgalorg. I'm pretty sure I can take you, bro. Not after I absorb the power and knowledge of that comet. Absorb a triple salchow to your kneecaps. Oof! - Whoa! - Whoa! - Grab my hand! - Okay. Shoot. Hey, stop drifting! I'm not trying to! Ooh! Maybe I can use jet propulsion. Oh, no, I can't breathe. Jake, no! Don't worry, man! I'm working out a plan! Freaking bing bong! Jake's gonna fulfill his croak dream after all. And that dirty umbrella is gonna enslave the universe. Cram come on. This is gonna take forever. Man, I'm gonna croak out here, like a fish in the hands of a child. Okay, Finn. Time to make an appeal to greater forces.  Everything's falling into place I'm right where I should be The tides of life all led me here And that's why I'm not scared I know the answer will appear, ple-e-e-ease  Hey, spaceman. Wha dad?! This is so crazy, Finn. What are you doing out here? Floating to my grave! Hurry up and save me! Can't, buddy. This baby does what it wants. Are you kidding me?! No, for real. Look. Hey.  Get that guy there! See? I'm just flying random-style. It's not random! I merged my intention with the universe. You what? Oh! Wait. I have an idea. Really? Here grab on this. No, it's cool. You got gloves on. Oh, yeah. You all right? Yeah. Thanks, dad. Thanks, universe. Come again? Oh! We got to save Jake! He's out there choking on gas! Like I said, I got no control over this beast. We're on a journey into mystery, unless I figure out what this bozo responds to. It's kind of fun, right? See, there's no reason or purpose or what you said Uh, universal intention. Look around, Finn. Empty crud. So empty. I don't know. There's some stars and stuff. You're squeezed so tight, your bottom's gonna fall out. Put the phone down. "Put the phone down"? Yeah Whoa! What's going on, huh? Look! The light of the comet. Ahh. That's pretty neat. This moth is so bananas, man. "Bananas, man." "Bananas, man." Uh-oh. What's that? Almost there. That dude's gonna absorb the comet's mystical power and crush everybody. Who the heck raises guys like that? You think he had neglectful parents, like you? Or would he have always  been a no-good Orgalorg? Oh, Gob Slops! Not Orgalorg! You you you know him? Yeah! What do you think I'm a dumb brick? I don't know Orgalorg? Oh, yeah. Snaps! He ate the comet! I got to stop him. It's too late, buddy. It's out of our hands. Skronk that! I'm gonna use these hands to sock him in the chops! In the chops! Hey! Dinglord! In the name of The universe, stop that! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Grass sword. Raaa! Huh? Yah-ta-ta-ta-ta! Whoa. I didn't open this door. Cool. Finn, do you remember? Oh. Yeah, I-i think so. A long time ago, I was you, sort of. And I crashed on earth and became a butterfly or some biz. And I guess it was just some random absurd thing, just a joke I've been playing out for centuries. Who's creating the joke? Are you? And if so, then are you my creator? Uh, maybe. I don't know. Probably not. Probably not, but who knows? I've been around forever and experienced so much impossible junk. I've embodied all that is good and evil. And now we're here. It's unprecedented. And I give you a choice Come with me to the end and the beginning or struggle here awhile like a beautiful autumn leaf. What's that bell sound? Cool, man. This is your crisis. As you stand on the edge of freedom from love Hate Friendship Isolation Jealousy Secrets Violence Video games Ice-cream waffles Sadness Madness Power Honor Loyalty Saucy Mothers Fathers Scoundrels. How long are you gonna list stuff? It's a long list. You're telling me to abandon all this stuff, but you're not really making it sound bad. It's not bad. I'm just giving you the choice of a new mode of existence. I feel like I put a lot of work into this meat reality. I'd like to see it through. Fair enough. Hey, how about I get a new mode? Are you seriously trying to bail out again?! What? This deal sounds pretty good. Dad. Uh-oh. I know that look. When you fled the scene like a ding-dong-ditcher in the night Listen, Finn. No answer I give you will be satisfying. Besides, it was like 40 years ago. I'm 16! I don't have a star to revolve around to track time. Well, why do you always run from everything? You burn enough Bridges, the only direction to move is forward. Hm. Well, there ain't no changing you, I guess. Well, I'm glad we finally understand each other. Start the engine, comet boy! Prepare to discorporate. Goodbye, son! Bye, dad. I should have asked for a lift home. Unh! Jake! I thought I had lost You. Noooooo! - You okay, Finn? - What?! Jake! Banana man?! How? I was just floating around, and I drifted into B-man's flight path. Pretty random, right? I-I-it wasn't random. I did it. Let's get the jazz out of here. Nooooo! There we go. See? Problem took care of itself. You think Finn and Jake are all right? I'd say it's about a 50/50 chance. That's pretty much everything in life, isn't it? Yeah. Whoa! What's that?! Hey, PB. We took care of it. Good job, guys. Mm, I'm gonna croak out here.

    I blows.]  Finn, lunch is ready! Oh! What are you cooking? It's good, man. I learned it from Rainicorn. I'm not eating that. It smells funny. Dude, this took me, like -- FINN: Let's go over to Tree Trunks' and get some apple pie.  Apple pie! Apple pie! Apple pie! Let's go! Whoa! FINN: Tree Trunks! Tree Tr--  Tree Trunks! Tree Trunks?  Apples. My apples. Apples? You! You took my apples! Whoa! Whoa! Tree Trunks, it's us -- Finn and Jake. Finn? And -- and Jake? It's okay, Tree Trunks. We're here to help you. Just tell us what happened. They took them. They took all of them. All of what? Apples. My apples that I raised with love -- from mere seedlings. Without my special apples, I won't be able to bake any more apple pies. BOTH: Noooooo! Don't you worry, Tree Trunks, we'll find those thieves and bring them to justice. Let me show you the crime scene. You see, boys, scads of apple trees but -- but no apples. Hmm. Is anything else missing, Tree Trunks? No, Finn. They didn't touch my rocks or my birds or my flowers or -- or nothing. Hmm. Well, I don't see any footprints. What you got, Jake? No ghost doodies. Oh. Oh, wait. Oh, no. No. Hmm. Tree Trunks, is there anyone you can think of who might want to krunk you up? Oh, no, Finn. I take great care to assure that -- that I'm loved by even the most heinous JAKE: Hey, guys, I found something! Look!  Oh, hey. Hey, Finn.  Oh, hey, Raggedy Princess. Have you seen anything fishy going on? Um, no.  I've been kind of down this hole for a long time.  I got knocked down here by some Ne'er-do-wells. It was terrible. I was so scared. Ne'er-do-wells? They stole my apples. I'm gonna sass those boys up nasty!  Awesome. Where do we find these guys? Oh, the Candy Tavern, man. I used to hang out there back when I used to snatch old ladies' purses.  Don't worry. I stopped doing that a long time ago. I didn't know it was wrong.  Okay, you two, let's get going.  Uhh!  Oh, my!  Uh, does Princess Bubblegum know about this place? Be cool, man. You're gonna queer the deal. Oh, yeah. Try not to act suspicious, Tree Trunks. Okay, I won't. ALL: Where -- Oh! Where's my dang apples?  Tree Trunks, you're so silly. But -- but listen. You wouldn't happen to have seen any -- I don't know -- apples around, have you? Seen any apples? You ask a lot of dumb-butt questions, almost like you're trying to solve something. What? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. Mm. Clean, too. Almost like some do-gooders! Hold on. We got to go potty. Dang. They almost got us. But I think we blend in pretty well now. This -- this toilet paper's drying my -- my mouth all up. Tree Trunks, don't eat that. Here. You got to watch your man. Oh, I look just like an army brat. What can I do for you? You know where a guy might maybe score some apples?  Well, when you put it like that, a couple of buddies I know have some apples for sale. I'll show you. Hey, fellas, these folks been asking about your apples. Okay- Show 'em the apples, Smudge. Grab 'em! You go back, and you tell your boss to stop looking for those apples, 'cause they're ours now! W-what boss? Your boss -- Dr. J. We don't know any Dr. J. Liar! Ouch! Come on, Smudge.  Dr. J. Gonna take myapples. What just happened? I guess these guys who stole Tree Trunks' apples also stole Dr. J.'s apples, and they thought we were working for him. Finn, Finn. Hmm? This could be dangerous. And if you want to go back home, I understand. But I need to do this. Yeah, Tree Trunks. Me too. JAKE: Hey, Finn. Hmm? What's that on your face, buddy? Oh, the guy bopped me one. Must have had a ring on. You know, I think I seen that symbol somewhere before. Yeah. Right next door to where I used to hock stolen bikes. What?! I didn't know it was wrong. Yeah, you see, that guy must work here or something. Hello? Who's the heck happening? What? Uh, we're here about the apples. Oh. Okay. Let's see your ring. Um here.  Come on in. Follow this guy. My boss is gonna be real psyched I found someone to buy his apples. A whole crate. What the -- what's wrong, guy? These aren't apples. Oh, it didn't mean "diamonds"? All Ne'er-do-wells call diamonds "apples," like calling money "Bread" or rock-knockers "Butterslaps." Hey, Wormo, we're back. What the -- what are theydoing here? They're here for the apples. That's the dang Dr. J. Gang, Wormo. Grab them! Um, Sir  I promise if you let us go, we won't tell no one about your apples. Feed 'em to the pig. Yeah, the pig.  Yeah. All right.  I'm sorry, y'all. They're making me do this. I'll -- I'll try to make it quick. MAN: Hold it! Dr. J.! Yeah, yeah, and I want my apples back. BOTH: Get 'em, boys.  I Crying softly.] Ah, don't cry, Tree Trunks. But we're never gonna find those apples. Apples? You guys looking for apples? Uh, yeah. Why? 'Cause I can hear a bunch of apples in this room. You mean apples as diamonds? Nope. Apples as apples? Yep. You mean apples that we eat? Yes. With all due respect, Mr. Pig, Sir, my apples were stolen by a dirty, rotten criminal who needs to be put in jail! I'm just telling you the facts, ma'am. What I hear is a whole pig-load of apples inside that closet. They sound scared. Well, I hate to tell you this, boys, but there's no apples in this closet. You see, uh, I'm the only one who knows how to open this closet.  Oh! So I was the apple thief, after all. No, Tree Trunks. That's preposterous. No, Finn. I'm a criminal, and I need to pay the price.  Banana guard speaking. Uh, this is Tree Trunks. I've done something horrible, and I want you to come over and arrest me. FINN: Tree Trunks, you don't need to do this. Thank you, Finn and Jake, but I won't let myself slip away from such a terrible crime. Goodbye. Tree Trunks Uh, this is hard to watch. I'm gonna look away.  This place could use a scarecrow. Huh? Wait. What'd you say? I said, "This place could use a scarecrow." A scarecrow no footprints All those magpies on the roof Raggedy Princess in the ditch And all the apples in Tree Trunks' closet. Boy, this place could use a scarecrow. That's it! I knew it!  The magpies have been stealing the apples and accidentally dropping them in this hole. And that's why there weren't any footprints around the tree. Yes! And the magpies were able to steal the apples because Raggedy Princess wasn't sitting on the fence post to scare them off. Does this mean I'm innocent? As innocent as a baby's butt cheek.  Awesome. This calls for a celebration. You know what that means, Tree Trunks. I'm-a bake you the biggest and the tastiest apple pie you boys ever tasted.  BOTH: Whoa! Uh, you boys better stick around if you want to bite of my apple pie. She slapped my butt.    FINN : This party is so crazy!


      FlNN: Candy party! Jake, this party is so crazy! l know, Finn. l know.  GlRL: So, Finn, do you have a girlfriend? Oh, my gosh, l can't believe you just said that!  What a wonderful, marvelous party! Okay, l'm gonna do it. Okay, okay, okay. Everyone watch! l'm gonna do a flip!  Whoa, oh, oh!  Ohh! Oh, no!  Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee  Whoo, whoo!  Princess Bubblegum's in trouble! Watch where you're going!  Holy cow! ls the Princess okay? Ooh! Please, calm yourselves, my people. l am safe! Oh, thank you, Finn. You truly are my hero this day. Cool. Hero. Hmm. Uh, what did you think of? l'll show you. Come on. We'll go through my secret entrance. All right, everyone. Turn around. Well, turn around! This entrance is secret! Oh! Secret entrance. Got it. Math. Hurry, Finn!  No way!  Here it is. Check it out. A magical globe? No, Finn. lt's what you can see through the globe. Golly.  Look. You see this book? Yeah, l see it. lt's called the Enchiridion. lt's a book meant only for heroes whose hearts are righteous.  Shmow-zow! The book lies at the top of Mount Cragdor, guarded by a manly Minotaur. lt's waiting for a truly righteous hero to claim it! Do you think l've got the goods, Bubblegum? 'Cause l am into this stuff! Yeah, l know. And, yes, l do. Then off l go! Huh? Thanks, pal. Farewell, Fi-- Oh, wait a minute. Farewell, Finn the human boy! Bye, princess! You know what time it is, buddy? A-a-a-dventure time? Yeah, man!  Greetings, young heroes to be. This mountain is called Cragdor. lts purpose is twofold -- to protect the Enchiridion and to test the hearts of those who seek to possess it. Many noble challengers have entered, attempting to pass the grueling trials that lie behind these walls, but no one has ever left here alive or dead. Only the truest, most worthy hero can receive the hero's Enchiridion and walk out these doors again.  lf it is you, friend -- ooh-hoo, and l cannot say that l am certain, but you are verily welcome to try. However, first you must pass my riddle. My name is Keyper, and duly so, for l carry the key to this door. But all is not how it appears, you see. Or perhaps you don't see at all.  Perhaps the key is in you, child, but you cannot use your brawn here. The door is magically sealed!  Ooh, you've unlocked the riddle and the door! Ha ha, brilliantly done, child. Please, reveal to me how you unraveled my clue. l just thought you'd look cute stuffed in that lock. Oh, yes. That's how most people get in. - Bye! You've passed the first trial, young heroes, but prepare yourselves, for there are many trials ahead of you. And each trial is more treacherous than the last.  The Enchiridion is  that way. What?! Dude, you can't smell the book from here! lt's in the castle on top of the mountain.  ln a room.  Wish you had one, huh? VOlCES: Help! Help! Oh, help! This way! What about the book? lt can wait. Someone needs our help.  Yo, Finn, are you all right? Did you get brain damage? l'm fine. Keep going. We have to hurry. Help! Save us! We're stuck in the fire! l've got you. Thank you for saving us. Now we can destroy this old lady.  La la la-la  What?!  Anytime you say, ''What?'' We'll destroy an old lady. What?! lt's a wonderful day.  Every time you say, ''No,'' we'll destroy an old lady. No! What?!  Please ohh! don't destroy ooh! any more aah! old women. Every time you look sad, we'll destroy a big old woman. Well, ever since l got to -- Hey, guys, every time he's a big wuss, let's destroy an old lady.  Yeah. Hey, back off, you gnomes! That kid just saved you guys. You should thank him, not destroy old ladies. Do you even know what l'm talking about? Say, ''Thank you.'' Saythankyou! Kill him! Get back in there! Help! Help! Please, help! JAKE: Hey, Finn, you okay? FlNN: No way, dude. Those old ladies are destroyed because of me. l'm not righteous. l'm wrong-teous. Stupid-teous.  Ah, don't let those gnomes and their illusions get you down. They're just gnomes and illusions. lllusions? Yeah, man. Think -- what would regular old sweet ladies be doing wandering the hills of Mount Cragdor? Maybe they're lost?  No way. This place is designed to mess you up, to mess with your head. None of this is real. lt's all just trials to test your heroic attributes. Hmm. Hmm! Now let's go get that book. Yeah, you're the smartest dog l know, man. Jake?  Give me back my friend! - No. lt's okay, Finn. l can get out. Let Jake go, or l'll -- l'll kick your foot!  lt is impossible for you to hurt me.  Don't worry, dude. l found another way -- Huh? l'm coming, buddy!  l think your dog finally fell into my stomach. Hey, where did you go? l got your wallet, man! No! My big money! Give it back! Give me back my friend! But l killed him already.  Fine. l'll give you your dollar. Here's your dolla-a-a-a-a-a-r!  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Jake! You're okay! Stomachs are weird.  all the way to the top! Wait a minute.  l can smell the book right through this door.  You're under arrest for stealing my dollar!  Just a minute, Jake. Hey!  You know what that was? That was righteous. Thanks, Jake. Now sniff out that book for me. You got it. Whoa! Cool! MAN: Congratulations, Finn the Human. You must be truly righteous to have made it this far. Thank you. Now enter my brain world, and l will show you some aspect of yourself that you're not entirely aware of. Wheream l? GHOUL: For your final trial, slay the beast! Why? ls it an evil beast? Will you slay it? Shoot, yeah. l'll slay anything that's evil. That's my deal.   FlNN: Thank you. Now, as one last last trial  slay this ant! ls it evil? No! But it's not good, either. lt's, uh, neutral. Will you slay it?  No! lf you want the hero's Enchiridion, then slay this unaligned ant! Never. Never. Never! Uh-oh. Hyah! KEYPER: Congratulations, Finn the human. Now you have truly reached the end -- Never! Ohh! Oh, no. Mr. Keyper, l'm sorry.

Princess Bubblegum's in my seat. We decided last time no reserved seating -- First come, first served. PRINCESS BUBBLEGUM: What's that? Just stuff that comes at the beginning of the movies. Yeah, it's on all the movies we dig up. PRINCESS BUBBLEGUM: I don't know. It seems pretty important, Finn. All right. Let's take a look. Pause, Beemo. BOTH: "Warning -- federal law provides severe and criminal penalties for the unauthorized exhibition of copyrighted motion pictures." All right, well, goodbye! Sorry we had to cancel. We've been showing these films unauthorized! But these movies are before the Great Mushroom War. We should still respect authority, Mang.  Yeah? Are we meeting next week to watch a movie? Uh Uh, yeah, maybe. I-I think so. Finn, don't cancel movie club! I've literally been having the time of my life. Calm down, y'all. We're gonna have "Finn and Jake Movie Club" next week for sure. Jake and I just have to find a movie without that warning. Good! Okay. All right, well, we'll see you next time! Bye-bye! Dude, we've never found a movie without that warning. We're not gonna find a movie, Jake.  Well, what are we gonna do?  We're gonna make one! Wow-p! BOTH: Movie filming time! Okay, Beemo. Turn to your right and start filming. Start to truck in.

Looks great! Wait, what about this? BOTH: That's even better! Uh What do you think? I don't get it. It's just a bunch of random junk. Yeah, I'm not engaged. I need to see something that reflects life as it is, but, you know, entertaining. Yeah, like a romantic comedy. Exactly -- an action adventure. Wait, that's not what I said. Let's get to filming! Okay, Slime Princess! In this scene, you're gonna leap over to that vine swing over the crocodiles do a triple flip with a full twist, and land clean! Don't fall in the water, or you'll get eaten alive! Action! No! No smooching! Cut! I thought it was great. No, we can't use any of it. I think we should use all of it. No, not all. We should throw away the parts where Slime Princess was smooching. That was dumb. What?! Du-u-u-u-u-u-u-mbah! Okay, you're having a picnic. You're in love, but you can't admit it. So you're having a playful food fight. And action!  Why did you do that?! Cut, cut, cut!  Cut! That was not what I wanted! That was awesome! We need to shoot more stuff like that.  What's next? FINN: Okay, PB. Move back a little. Stop! Finn? - FINN: Yeah? BUBBLEGUM: How does this work? Um Jake's gonna get the frog to hop toward him, and when he does, you're gonna run alongside the chariot, and it's gonna look like you're driving it. Okay. Hey, Finn. Yeah? How about when the chariot takes off, she says something like, "Mm, check, please!" What?! No, that's terrible. Andaction!  Check, please? Aw, Jake! You -- you brought the fly in too close! I'm sorry. Well, help me catch him.  Well, I thought it was funny. This isn't a comedy! Not the way you're shooting it. Look, just help me catch this guy. All right, but after this, we do my part. Okay, everyone, it's been a long day. Lot of  a lot of running around, chasing frogs.  But we are making a movie, and this is the big wedding scene. Mr. Cupcake, you're playing Todd Johnson. Yes. And, Lady, you confess that you never loved Todd Johnson and that you were just trying to win a bet with your snooty socialite friends.  And then you both realize you do love each other, and you both say, "I do." And then, Shelby, you say "Check, please!"  Yeah. Don't forget to look right in the camera and slap your cheeks like this  And One, two, three, action! Do you, Todd Johnson, take this Rainicorn to be your lawfully married wife? Oh.  Lady! Cut! Cut, cut, cut! I didn't tell you to flex out!  No! I don't like the way he's flexing at you! I don't hear her complaining. Why, you --  Check, please! How much longer till you finish editing, Beemo? About 20 hours. Yeah. You guys shot a lot of footage About 20 hours. Jake, let's talk about our movie. Okay. I think we shot a lot of great stuff Uh-huh. but I'm thinking only half of it is usable. Me too. Really?! Yeah, I was just thinking that. That's great! I know! You actually agree it's an action-adventure! Yep, it -- wait! No! What?! Romantic comedy! What?! What do you mean, "What?!" Who's right, Beemo? Yeah! Me or Finn?!  We'll ask him when he wakes up. Why wait? "Dear Beemo please use only the best footage when cutting the movie. Love, Jake." "And Finn." See you at the movie club, then! Oh, I'll be there! As will I. As will I as well. Yes. Oh, yes. Ugh! I can't wait! Oh! I can't wait!  All right. Thanks again, everyone, for coming to  Movie Night!

Well, I guess we'll see! Yeah, I guess we will! Start the movie, Beemo! It's a little awkward.   Ooh! Ahh! Oh, my gosh!  Finn, why are you fighting with your friend? Jake, you know this can't be the end Romance or action does not matter Hurting your friend will make you sadder Guys, you know you're much more than this You two, please stop, or you'll undo All that you've been through Ooh Just hug, and it's agreed Your love will not delete - Yes! - Yeah!

     Hey, man, it's couples-only movie night tonight. Who are you bringing? I don't know. Who are you bringing? I'm bringing my girlfriend, dude. Oh.  I'll take this duck. It's couples night. You got to bring somebody you can smooch. Man, I don't wanna be smooched. Don't have to smooch. Just have to bring somebody you can smooch. It's like the rules. Lame.  Aah! Well, I'll take this blanket.  Put the blanket down. Have a seat. I want to explain some "things" to you about couples.  So, you all square? - Yeah, yeah. Who you gonna call? FINN: I'm going to call a girl that I don't have to kiss. - Hello? - Hi, Princess. Would you go to couples movie night with me? Sounds romantic, Finn. No! I-I was just wondering if you wanted to go with me. No, sorry, Finn. I'm busy practicing for the Whistling Choir Death Match Championship. - But -- - Auf wiedersehen.  - She doesn't want to go. - Yeah, she does. We just need to help her to realize she wants to go to the movies with you. I'm calling Marceline. - What? - Look, man -- I've been learning a lot about vampires lately. I realize now that my fear was based on ignorance. Speak. Hey, hey, Marceline. Got a favor to ask, babe. We want to make Princess Bubblegum jealous so she'll go to the movies with Finn. Marceline? Come in. Hello?  - Aah!  Are you gonna help us? Yeah, I'll help. It'll be funny. JAKE: Okay, so, here's the plan -- you start saying things, and you start laughing way loud. And then Bubblegum  will get jealous of you, which will awaken her Finn love. You start us off. Um Hmm. Funny. Funny. Um Giddyup? Umdiggy-diggy?  Diggy-diggy! Diggy-diggy! Greetings, Finn. Hey, Marceline. Hello, Bonnibel. Yeah, yeah. So, what's so funny, Finn? I, um, uh it's, uh, something. Well, then keep it down out there. I'm trying to whistle practice.  That was great. Now we begin phase two. It's so powerful. Wait here.  Hey, look, Finn -- I know Jake's your friend and all, but if you really want Bubblegum to go to the movies with you, you've got to, like, stop listening to your dog and take some advice from a real girl. But Jake said phase two is powerful. Pbht! How is Jake gonna know what girls want more than a real girl? - Yeah -- - Okay, great. So, what we need now is somethingfun. Girls love fun more than anything. Fun, fun, fun. If you can show Bubblegum that you're fun, she'll defs want to go to the movies with you.  You said "fun" so much. It sounds all weird now. "F-F-Fun." "F--" So, what do you like to do for fun, Finn? Oh! Oh! I like to wrestle and fight! Grr! Roar! Girls don't like that. No, no, that's perfect. All you got to do is get in there and wrestle Princess Bubblegum and show her how fun you are. "Fun-n-n." "Fun-n-n-n." Whoa. Where you going, man? Check it out. What is that stuff? It's a lute suit.  Girls love it. Trust me. Finn, what the plum are you wearing? You look horrible. It's a lute suit. And Finn looks adorable in it. Well, it's going to ruin the plan. What's she talking about, Finn? Well, I was gonna give Marceline's idea a try, too. Her idea? What's wrong with my idea? Oh, hey, Finn. Did you ever find some -- Whoa. What are you wearing? Oh, this is my lute suit. Uh Oh, this is my  lute suit Finn! That is hilarious.  Oh, you are killing me.  Psst. Grr-rr! Oh, yeah. So Headlock! Grr! Aah! Ugh! Aah! Guards!  That suit was ridiculous. Ridi-- ridiculous? What? Can you believe this girl, Finn? Huh? Can you? I guess the suit did feel a little silly. Well, fine. You can just give it back, then. I'm sorry. Good luck getting to that movie without my help. Harumph. Gee, he seems pretty ticked. Nah, he just needs some spaghetti. Oh, okay. Well, taste this, then -- I got a new plan. Really? The only thing women love more than fun is excitement. She needs to feel her blood pump, man. She needs to be chased by wolves. Like, metaphorically? Come on, I'll teach you how to show a girl a good time. Hold tight. You ready? Uh mm-hmm.    Shh. She's probably asleep.  This was a really good idea. Now don't blow it this time. Okay. Aah!  Oh, Finn, thank goodness you're here! There's wolves in my room! Yeah, I know. I put them there. Pretty exciting, right? I'm sorry to do this, Finn, but until you stop acting like a psycho, you are forbidden from entering The Candy Kingdom. Farewell.  I don't understand, Marceline. I tried everything. I guess she just doesn't like me. Shh. Come on, Finn -- a brainlord like Bonnie? You'd be bored with her in a week. And anyway, I, for one, think you're pretty great.  I'm sorry it didn't work out like you wanted. I'll see you later, I guess. Marceline. Of course! It's been Marceline all along.  Hey, man, I've been looking for you. Sorry for acting like a dweeb before. Want some leftover spaghetti? Ah, no, thanks, man. But I really need your help. 'Bout time!   Uh-oh.  Diddle lee bown, dowm-dowm Diddle lee bown, bah bah bah  Marceline! Will you go to the movies with me?! We need to talk.  Good evening, my dear Your escort is here  Finn, you do not want to go down that road with me. With you, I would walk down any road, milady, especially if it leads to the movies. Oh, yeah? No one would want to go to the movie withthis!  What do you think of me now?! How do you like your popcorn? Ugh! You're starting to annoy me. Well, then let's do something fun, like to go the movies! Get off me. Finn, I like you, but -- Headlock! No! Listen to me. I'm not gonna go to the movies with you. I just don't like you that way. I'm sorry, Finn. I just I don't want to date you. Date me? Man, I just want to go to the movies, but everybody hates me. Wait -- you don't want me to be your girlfriend? Huh? No! Movies! If you weren't looking for a girlfriend, then why were you romancing it up all day? 'cause Jake said couples nights have weird kissing requirements and romance-initiation rituals and whatever else. I didn't really say all that.  Of course I'll go with you, Finn. - You will? - Yeah, as friends. Of course as friends. But no tongue. Ye-- what?! Oh, man, I can't believe I'm finally going to see this movie. Oh, mon cher, I guess this is goodbye. No, not goodbye.  Let's say farewell!  Ugh! Couples night sucks! Marceline, would you do me the honor of getting the plop out of here? There's nothing I'd like more. Aah!  Nothing can ever tear us apart. Yeah!   This party is so crazy!


    Just about done. Mmm. Oh, boy. How much softy cheezy for your deezy? A little? A lot? Blech! None! But you used to love softy cheese. I don't want to talk about it. - What was that? - Probably an owl. Mmm. Mm-mmm --  A ghost!  Doo, it's just Ghost Princess. Hey, G. P.!  She's weird, huh? How's it going?  Are you haunting us?  Yes-s-s. Oh, okay.  Well, can you knock it off? Sorry. It's just I'm doomed to haunt this mortal plane. Oh. Let's hear more about that, honey. Until I discover the cause of my death, my soul can't ascend to the 50th dead world. But as a ghost, I have no memory of my mortal life and no idea how I died.  It's a crime case! Whoa! Step back, nephew! We don't know that she was "moidered." That's right! We don't even know how she was "moidered." But I'm the hard-boiled sleuth that's gonna crack your case wide open. Oh! That sounds wonderful! This way, gentlemen. Whoa. Your neighborhood is uh very peaceful. It's the cradle of my despair. Right, right. Well, here's me. Our first clue! "Fee-may-ale." It's a good start, but we need more. Jake, it's time to interrogate the neighbors. We'll do it "good cop, bad cop"-style. I call "bad cop"! Aww! Yo, ghost! Yo, yo! Yo, wake up, fool! Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo! What?! Yo, ghost, what do you know about the lady buried next to you? - What, you mean her? She's been here longer than almost everybody! He's right!  And don't think I don't see what you do, Ghost Princess. What? Sneaking off at night, scaring peeps, haunting at all hours -- 'cause you can't deal with your issues! MAN: Leave her be, Boilbee! Wha-a-a-t?! A princess deserves empathy -- not your sass. Ohhh! Ahh!  Butt out, Clarence. Some of us still want to feel, you know -- the vital  magnetism of life, the vibrating energies that connect all living and non-living beings. Nyah! I don't like your words! Nyah! I'm Ghost Princess. Have we met before? I feel like we have. I don't think so, milady, but I am honor-ed. What do you know about Ghosty P's getting murdle-erdled? Sorry. I don't know anything. I can't imagine anyone who would harm someone as beautiful as this.  Whoa. Smooth. Did you try looking yonder? That's where the nÃ©er-do-well ghosts hang out. Right. Ne'er-do-wellers. Let's do this, Jake! You stay and eat cheese puffs.  Geez. Look at this place. It's all bunked up. Yeah, no wonder this is where the nÃ©er-do-wells go when they deezy. I got a feeling these ghosts are gonna be harder to shake than Boilbee. Yeah. Well, get ready, 'cause this biz is gonna get ridonk. Cool, man! Hey, can I be "bad cop" now? No. Okay. Let's check this guy out. - JAKE: What's it say? - FINN: "Some Donkus." Wake up, Donkus! We got questions! Dingus! Time to sing, ya canary!  Bam! Yah! What you know about Ghost Princess, huh?! Give it up, Dungus! Hey, man, take it easy. You do your job, Ido mine!  Tell me what you know, punk!  Uh-oh. What's this? A busted knife. Is this your knife, bro? Tell me! Jake -- "good cop"! JAKE: Oh, right. Cool out, "bad cop"! No! Aah! This ghost ain't home, man!  Well, you're lucky my partner's here pal. - He's not worth it, man. - Hmph! These ghosts think I'm playing. They think it's all a big game. But you know what? You know what I'm gonna do? What? I'm gonna turn this game upside downH  GHOST PRINCESS: So, you really don't know how you died, either? CLARENCE: Of course not. Two, please. And we might never find out. But that's okay, because right now, in this moment, I'm feeling pretty sweeties, you know? I feel sweeties also in this moment, also. - That's great, Ghost Princess. I'm glad we can feel this way together in the face of uncertainty. Ladies and gents! The center for ghost-community outreach and ghostdatescom present Spirit Waves! More beautiful than I could imagine. Are you talking about Spirit Waves? I'm talking about you, Princess. Ya-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-h! Ghosts! You ghosts! Come out! Rah!  I think this place is abandoned, man. They're just hiding 'cause they know they're guilty! MALE GHOST: Yo! Yo! That's my grave! Why are you fops trashing our spot?  We thought you were hiding. Dude, we were at the Spirit Waves show. Kill these fools! ALL:  Bring it on, you mamas! CLARENCE: Hold up! These guys are with me. A'ight, Clarence, but only because of that one time when I did that thing by accident and you were cool about it. It's your lucky day, punks. Whew! Thanks, Clarence! Yo, I'm sorry we haven't solved the case yet. It's all right, Finn. I'm calling off the investigation. What? Why'? I don't feel tormented anymore now that I'm with Clarence. Oh, really? That's -- that's cool. It's hard to explain, but it's like we already know each other. I feel it, too. Our spirits must be entwined in the cosmic wheel of time. Nice. Let's go to my private mausoleum, where we can be private. Yuck. GHOST PRINCESSS: Thanks for your help! A'ight!  Aw, man. I wanted to crack the case, you know? Look on the bright side, guy. We looted all this sweet grave booty! Ka-ching! Jake! You looted?! That's bad, man! You're supposed to be "good cop." Oops. I didn't know it was wrong. Come on. Let's put all this stuff back. - What?! All of it?! - Yes, Jake. Huh. This dagger says, "Renee." - What's that? I guess Some Donkus' real name was "Re-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-nce!" Have we met before? It's hard to explain, but it's like we already know each other. Is this your knife, bro? This ghost ain't home, man! What is it, dude?  We got to dig up the princess.  Look! Sorry. Lookit! "Clarence." Clarence was "Some Donkus"! Some Donkus ski-bopped Ghost Princess!  - JAKE: Stop! Clarence is your murdler! CLARENCE: Warrior Princess, give up your kingdom! Never -- not even to you, my love!  Unh! Clarence, I ahh My love! N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!  I did it? I forgive you, Clarence. Take my hands! Ascend with me to the 50th dead world! I can't! My soul is stuck! I have to know hovv ldied! Oh, glob! My life is like a fart. Whoa, wait a minute. Say that again. My life is like a fart! I know you, man -- from the Squeezy Mart! Huh? Uh, Squeezy Mart? I'm starting to remember. I was a broken man.  More. I think you've had enough, man. I don't care. My life is like a fart. Huh? My life is like a fart!  Hey! Hey, stop that! Citizen's arrest!  Hey, be careful, man!  So, that's why you don't like softy cheese. GHOST PRINCESS: Clarence! CLARENCE: Ghost Princess! Congratulations, you kids!  Yeah! - Goodbye! - Thanks for everything! - Thanks for everything. - Goodbye. You sure you're ready for this, man? Yeah. Give me one of them cheesy dogs, man.  All gone? Let me see. Move your tongue left Bleh bleh. - and right. - Bleh. I'm proud of you, pal -- real proud. 


    Thanks for helping me record, Finn. No problem, Marceline. Now, I'm gonna sing something really personal, so don't laugh at me. I would never dream of it, Milady.  Now, start a slow beat and keep it steady or it'll mess up everything. You got it.  Badda-badda, badda-badda.  Daddy, why did you eat my fries? I bought them, and they were mine But you ate them Yeah, you ate my fries, and I cried But you didn't see me cry Daddy, do you even love me? Well, I wish you'd show it 'Cause I wouldn't know it What kind of dad eats his daughter's fries And doesn't look her in the eyes? Daddy, there were tears there If you saw them, would you even care?  Huh? Finn, you messed the beat up! Marceline, if you're thinking about your dad so much, then why don't you go see him? He's not worth the effort. Not worth what effort? Well, first, I'd have to draw a circle with a happy face in the center and then, uh, douse it with bug milk. Oh, yeah?!  And then you're supposed to chant something like, "Maloso vobis com et cum spiritum!"  But I-I don't really want to see him. I'm still mad about the thing with the fries.  Huh!? What?! Whoa, whoa! Aah! Marceline! Finn, what the heck did you do?! I reunited you with your family?  Is this kid your evil servant? I'm not evil, Marceline's Dad! I'm super good! Super good? What are you doing?! MARCELINE'S DAD: Stealing your soul!  Dad! Ugh, you always do stuff like this!  Oh, Marceline. I never know what's gonna set you off. MARCELINE'S DAD: Whoa, is this the family axe? Hey! Did you turn it into some kind of lute? MARCELINE: Give it back and get out! 'Kay, I'll go. I've got business to attend to anyway, sucking up all the souls in Ooo. What?! No! See you kids later.  My bass! I've unleashed evil onto Ooo! We've got to stop him, Marceline! Fine, but I'm only coming with you to get my bass back.  Hey, how do I kill this guy anyway? Finn, you can't kill my dad! Oh, I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean -- No, you literally can't kill my dad. He's deathless. Oh.  Huh? Who the fluff are you? Um, well, I'm sure not the guy who's gonna suck out your soul. Good, 'cause that's, like, my number-one fear. Really? Well, I know a little exercise for that. Want to try it? Well First, close your eyes. Okay. Aah! You could've killed me! Ah, but I didn't. And now aren't you thrilled just to be alive? Yeah, I guess. So what? So, this next part will be all the more horrifying. There, below us -- a gathering of fluffy people! Mayhaps they've seen your father! Marceline, release the Finn bomb!  Phosh!  They're all freaked out. It's because they're scared of him.  Mmm. My dad's been here. Come on, let's go. FINN: No! We've got to help this guy.  I've got some soul food that Jake packed for me. You like, uh, collard greens or country fried steak?  Look, you want to help him? Help me get my bass back! How will that help him? My dad stole my bass guitar, Finn! And when I get it back, I'm gonna break it over his neck and slam my dad back into the Nightosphere!  Oh, clam! But first, you got to return the souls your dad sucked back to these sad little husks, right, Marceline?  Uh, sure. Yeah, yeah, we'll do that. MAN: So, I popped his head like a cork and I says, "That's what I think of expanding Earth theory! "  MARCELINE'S DAD:  All right ALL: Huh?! I've got a joke, too. What wears a dark suit, is completely evil, and is about to suck out all your souls? Your mama! That's right -- I'm your mama. MARCELINE: Red rock pass. If my dad wants to get through the mountains, he'll have to go through here. We can work together and smash him with this rock. And once he's smushed, all the souls will go back to their rightful bods. MARCELINE'S DAD: Stompin' on ants Suckin' their souls Stompin' on ants Souls, souls, souls   Huh?  So, finally taking a run at your old man, huh?  Daddy!  Karate kick!  Marceline, keep him right there! Hyah!  Oh.  Karate chop!  You can't destroy me!  N-no. D-Dad, I don't want to destroy you. Look, just stay out of my life! You're not even alive! You blew it, dude. We're supposed to be a team -- A team who's sport is "Stop your dad from sucking souls" ball.  I just want my dad to care about me. MARCELINE'S DAD: Of all history's greatest monsters, you are by far the most evil thing I've encountered. Offer your soul to me, dark one. Wenk! Wenk! No! You can't have my soul! I don't even -- Look, just get in here.  Wenk! Wenk! Keep your crummy soul! Wenk! Wenk! Wenk! Wenk! Wenk! Wenk! Wenk! Gunter, who told you you could fly?! Wenk.  Huh? No one sucks the life from my penguins except me-- and maybe polar bears because that's just nature, Gunter. You darest encroach upon my domain! You've raised my frosty dander! And for that I shall  Aah! I've have soiled my tunic -- completely by choice!  Yes!  Oh, man! He's growing huge!  I'm gonna take him down! Finn, you're like an ant to him. Oh, yeah?! Well, this ant's about to get in his pants! What? Uh You know, because I'm gonna make him uncomfortable while I release those souls! Rrraaaaahhhh! Give up those souls, Marceline's dad, in the name of justice! Huh? Oh, Marceline. Still following me? I'll stop following you if you give me back my guitar! Now, Marceline No one flicks me in the butt without my consent!  Whoa, whoa! Aah!  Whoa!  Whoa! The souls! Lumpy Space Princess, he got your soul, too? What? Nah. I totally saw Hot Dog Princess get sucked in here, and I wasn't invited?! I was all, "What the lump?!" So I'm crashing this party! Uh well, I'll save you. Yeah, I'll save all of you! Unh! Hyah!  Unh! In your face, Dad! Give back that axe, Marceline. You don't respect it enough. Well, you don't respect anything,Dad! Dad, I'm outta here! But -- MARCELINE'S DAD: Fine! Go! I'm too busy sucking to deal with you! No, wait! Marceline, keep talking to him! When he's talking, he can't steal souls! I said I'm out of here! Diversion. Need diversion. Daddy, why did you eat my fries? I bought them, and they were mine But you ate them Yeah, you ate my fries, and I cried But you didn't see me cry Daddy, do you even love me? Well, I wish you'd show it  Oh, my Glob, you guys -- drama bomb! Marceline, do you really feel this way? Dad, I  Look her in the eyes?  Marceline, of course I love you. Dad I'm sorry I ate your fries. I didn't mean to hurt you. It's okay, Dad. It's -- it's really okay. No, it's not okay. They weren't even very good. They were really cold. I love you, Marceline. Don't you ever doubt that. I love you, too, Dad. Oh, Marceline, I am so -- Maloso vobis com et cum spiritum!  I'll see you in the Nightosphere, you sick freak!  Yes! Finn! How could you do that?! How could I save the day? How could you embarrass me like that and then stab my dad?! How could I embarrass-save you? Whoa! Marceline!  I'm glad he's back in the Nightosphere. That was emotionally exhausting. I'm also exhausted emotionally -- or, wait, I-I mean, physically. I've been meaning to ask you -- What's with that pocket on your shirt? Oh, Jake's in here. 'Sup, Jake. 


     We're fuh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh Finn and Jake We'll muh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh make-a you, make  BOTH:  We'll make you cry Your mama lies Jake likes pies I'm a guy who'll stick my stick into your eye And you'll say why, why, why, why, why?  BOTH:  Why, why, why, why, why? why, why, why, why, why?  Pizza! MAN: Sir! My sir! - Hmm? A message from their majesties. King and Queen Lumpy Space! We can't find our baby girl! Oh! She's been missing for days!  Whoa! Stop your crying, you two. We'll help you find your daughter. We'll find her using Jake's muscles. Dude, show off your muscles. Whoo! No more tears, booblee bear. Please, take her these sandwiches we made. She loves these sandwiches. Thank you, boys! Whoo! Dude, I know where Lumpy Space Princess is. She's in the woods eating beans. Mm-hmm. This is gonna be easy as uh mm Easy as childbirth. Yeah, okay. MAN: Oh! Aah! Oof! Please! Please, help me. A monster is terrorizing our village and has eaten up all the crops! Why were you up here in this tree? I thought I saw some food, and I was hiding from the monster.  You must help. Hmm. I guess we can help this guy real quick and then get back to L.S.P. Where's your village? Um I don't remember. Howard remembers. Hey! It's Howard! Howard! You remember where the village is?! Yeah, I marked it on the map, but, uh it's only half --  Well, we're all ready. We can't leave yet.  ALL: All right, now we're ready. What's in the basket? Samiches! ALL: Food! Food! Food! Wait! You can't eat this food! It's not ours to give!  Now show us the way to your town. Too tired from hunger. Carry me?  Okay.  The monster lives in that windmill. We're too scared to go near it. BOTH: Nothing scares us!  Be alert. Anything could pop out of there and rip our faces off. Whoo! Be careful, Finn!  It's you! Finn! What the junk?! It's you! Oh! Sandwiches! L.S.P., what the heck are you doin' here? Are you in here making out with the monster?  No. I am the monster. Whaaaaaaaaaat?! It's a long story. It all started at my lumpin' parents' house. - Daughter. - Yeah? How are the sandwiches? They're lumpin' delicious, mom! You know, you could enjoy your mom's sandwiches every day if you came back more often. No. You can have them delivered to me at my apartment. We want you to move back home, sweetheart. What?! You invited me here under false pretenses?! Wait, sweetheart! We're just worried about you. Ha! Y'all don't think I can make it on my own?! I'll show you! I'm running away! I stormed out and left Lumpy Space forever. Oh. And then you found this windmill. No. Something else happened first. Keep listening. LUMPY SPACE PRINCESS: I was so cold, and I was so very hungry.  Uh, uh!  Oh, glob! Maybe I can make a shelter out of these nuts. It's not fair! I was rescued by a family of wolves. The Mama Wolf was all like, "We must take care of her as if she were our own." And Papa Wolf was all like, "This is a special child who needs special love because she's going to be great when she grows up." So these were talking wolves? No, they were normal wolves. I knew what they were thinking because of their body language. Stop interrupting, Finn! I found a home where I could act like myself. LUMPY SPACE PRINCESS: They took care of me.  I knew that if my parents could see me now, they'd be jealous of how lumpin' awesome I am. Oh, my glob! But then the drama started.  Stephanie, Sue, can you guys keep a secret?  Okay, here's the secret. I just saw Jessica making out with Mark behind Tony's back.  Stephanie, are you even listening? 'Cause I'm kind of freaking out right now! Tony's gonna come back from hunting any minute now and -- Hi, Tony! Oh, my glob. Guys, what are we gonna -- Oh.  So, should we say something to Tony? You guys! Tony, Jessica's cheating on you! Oh, my glob! Oh, my glob! Oh, my glob! Look, I'm sorry. I know it's none of my business I know!  Because I think Tony has a right to know, Stephanie!  Nuh-unh, Miranda! I do not like Tony! No, Jessica! Don't cheat on Tony with me!  Aah! Aah! Uh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh, glob! Ah! Aah! Oh, glob! Oh, no! Ah! Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaa! Aaaaaah! Oh, glob. LUMPY SPACE PRINCESS: I came upon a tribe of villagers.  Monster! Oh, I'm so hungry!  Monster! Ah! Monster! Anyway, then I found this windmill, and whenever I get hungry, I dress up like the monster, and I go eat all of the villagers' crops. L.S.P., you're stealing! Don't say that! You're makin' me feel bad.  Thanks, Finn. L.S.P., if you want to feel better, you should apologize to the farmers and make amends. - Really? - Yeah. That'll work. Monster! Monster! Monster! Monster! No! No, wait! Monster! Monster! I'm not a monster! I was just pretending to be a monster. ALL: Huh? And I'm sorry that you're starving because I ate all of your crops, even though you're all still really fat and I probably helped you lose some weight. Did she just call us fat? Don't get all bent out of shape! I'm just being honest! FINN: L.S.P.! What? That apology was terrible! VILLAGER: Look! The monster eats while it apologizes! Let's kill it!  Ohh!  Please don't kill me! We have to! Well, you don't have to. Yeah. You can just let her go. If we let her go, she'll keep eating our crops, and we'll starve! Why don't you just get your parents to buy you more crops? We are parents! Those crops were for our children! You guys are parents? Just like my parents L.S.P., are you okay? Yeah, Finn. I'm great. Here. I want you to have these sandwiches. ALL: Sandwiches? Yeah, they're really good. They're made with a lot of love.  It's working! I saved the village! And that's how I saved the village. Well, we're just glad you're home. Whatever. And thank you, Finn and Jake. No problem. Yeah, we didn't really do that much.    


1 (MOUSE SQUEAKS)  (PENGUINS CHIRP)  (ALL CHEERING)  (SCREECHES)  (QUACKS)    Honey, I'm home!  Oops. I forgot I lived alone.  Well, no bother.  I won the Golden Shovel Award  (LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS)  Candy Kingdom's premier award  for grave-digging excellence.  There. (CHUCKLES)  Now to hang up my tuxedo so it doesn't wrinkle.  (GASPS)  (TELEPHONE RINGS)  You're missing hangers, too?  Well, I don't really use hangers.  Oh, have you considered folding?  We better call Princess Bubblegum.  (CLICK)  And then I called you guys.  To find all the wire hangers?  Wouldn't you rather  have us fighting evil demons or something?  Maybe an evil demon is stealing all the hangers.  Hmm.  JAKE: See anything?  No, it's pretty quiet out there.  Yeah, but not so much in here.  Huh? What does that mean?  (FARTS) Ohh, Jake, no!  (LAUGHS) Wait, hold on.  JAKE: It's over, Ice King!  Oh, hi, guys.  What's going on?  Is kidnapping hangers your new thing now?  Yeah, man, you have, like, one muumuu, and you're wearing it.  You think is about hangers? Really?  Well, yeah,  because you're stealing all the hangers.  You're stealing everyone's hangers, dude.  It's about so much more!  Come back to my place, and I'll explain everything.  Hmm. Hmm.  See?  I dropped my keys down this deep hole.  I need all these hanger guys to help me snag them.  When I'm done, I'll return them all,  and that's an Ice promise.  (WARBLE!)  How long's this crack been here?  Forever. Before forever.  What the  (METAL CREAKING) Oh! Something's got me!  Let go of the hanger! Huh?  Let go! Oh.  (CREAKING STOPS)  This calls for an investigation.  All right. Stand back!  (GRUNTS)  Follow me, fellas!  Watch your heads.  (ICE THUDS)  Holy moly!  Do you know what this extra square footage means  when I decide to sell?  There's something in here.  - What is it? - I don't know.  Well, no rest for the sexy.  That's not the expression.  Boy, this is strong.  A lot stronger than my ice.  (GRUNTS)  (ICE CRACKLES)  (MUTTERING)  (GASPS)  Dudes!  Hello.  What year is this?  Uh, nobody really keeps time like that.  It worked!  I mean, I feel like it worked.  This is the future, right?  Who are you?  You're like a beautiful Ice King.  Oh, boy. Here we go.  Back off, son! I saw her first!  Chill, you guys.  (CHUCKLES) "Chill"? Get it?  I'm Patience St. Pim, the ice elemental!  Whoo!  Did you see that?  I made ice with my hands.  I'm Finn the human, and this is Jake the dog.  Hello.  - Who's a good boy?! - Ahem.  They call me the Ice King.  I also make ice.  He's been using his powers a lot today.  Hup!  Well, I think you're pretty groovy.  Do you wanna Wanna, wanna, wanna be my acolyte? Sure. What's that? Like a boyfriend?  More like an intern.  Oh.  Uh, no, you're right.  It is more like a boyfriend.  Cool!  You're cool!  Dialed in, you know?  (LAUGHS) Huh, what?  Yeah.  Uh, hey, this might be a weird question,  but do you know where the slime, candy, and fire dudes are?  She's talking about the princesses.  I'm starting to get a weird feeling.  Yeah. Let's not tell her  Oh, you must mean Slime Princess,  Princess Bubblegum, and Flame Princess.  (BLUMP!) Princesses?!  We're like this!  (FINGERS CRACK)  (GROANS)  Oh.  That is so fun.  Okay, now this next request may sound super sketch.  Okay.  I need you to round them up and bring them back here,  like, even if they don't want to come.  You think you could do that?  Are you kidding? That's in my wheelhouse.  Right up my alley!  Classic Ice King.  So, wait, is it in your wheelhouse  or up your alley?  - Classic Ice King. - FINN: Hold on a minute.  You can't make Simon start kidnapping princesses again.  Yeah, he's semi-reformed.  Excuse me for a second, boyfriend.  Okay, Jake  Wow!  You got their initials on there,  and look at those shapes.  We're kind of like a power couple.  Get me those princesses.  You got it, boss.  (HUMMING)  Huh?  Send me a postcard when you get there.  (CHUCKLES)  Hey.  Aagh!  Ice King! I'm gonna  Hold that thought.  (SIGHS)  (GASPS)  Aw, nice work, hon. Thanks.  The pink one, how old is she?  Like 18, 19?  Uh, yeah, sort of.  Ha. I remember being 18.  I'm 28. (GAGS)  Okay, I want to talk to them.  Allow me!  (SOFT GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS)  Hmm.  Gotta be careful.  All right, out of the way, Bernini.  Are you guys okay?  (GRUNTS)  I need to lie down.  Oh, I'm fine.  (GROWLS)  Finn and Jake?!  Ice King, what did you do?!  No, no, no! It was her!  Get our guests some beverages.  Hi, guys.  I know this is weird and confusing and weird,  but the good news is  I'm getting the band back together!  Isn't this great?  What are you talking about?  You really don't know?  That was pretty cool, right?  I made this ice chair with my hands.  Pretty chill, huh?  (SARCASTICALLY) Yeah. So chill.  The fact of the matter is  you guys have that power, as well.  Okay, remember when I said I was the ice elemental?  Remember?  Oh, no, wait, that was those guys!  (CHUCKLING) I told those guys, not you guys.  Those guys! Oh!  Okay, um, this is like basic elemental history, okay,  so just listen up. (CHUCKLES)  Ever since life began on this planet,  there have always been embodiments  of the four elements  Fire, ice, candy, and slime.  Across eons and millennia,  the four elementals lived and died and lived again.  I was the incarnation  of the ice elemental back in the day.  And you guys were there, too.  (DOOR CREAKS, BELL JINGLES)  We used to get coffee sometimes.  It was a non-magic world back then,  so our powers were limited.  But as we gathered more and more,  we began to see visions  Visions of the future.  The world was about to go through a transition,  "an epic cataclysm that we probably wouldn't survive."  It was scary to think about perishing.  But then I was like, "Hey, what if we don't perish?  What if I freeze us and we wait out this transition?"  But the old versions of y'all weren't into it.  Said, "You accepted  that the elements you embodied would live on."  Said I was in denial or something.  So I went out alone and froze myself.  And all of you bit it.  But now you're back!  And this world is crazy, right?  You got weird old wizards and talking dogs.  Yo, dogs didn't used to talk. Did you know that?!  Back then, we were so stifled.  At last, we can unlock our true potential!  (LAUGHING)  (CHUCKLING)  Did I mention y'all were dudes in the past?  This is so much better!  Totally!  (SCREAMING)  (GRUNTS)  (LAUGHING) Your face right now!  Oh, no!  I gotta get a picture of this.  Oh, wait. I need my charger.  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Food!  What a surprise!  It's a billion years later and you're still not cool.  Ladies, please don't fight.  There's enough Ice King to go around.  (GURGLES)  PATIENCE: I'm done hiding out.  Everybody out there is gonna know me soon.  (SCREAMS)  (GRUNTS)  (SCREAMS)  Woof.  Let's get out of here.  She's not going anywhere for a while.  Hey, I been there, sister.  What are you doing?  (MUFFLED) Helping.  Just scrape it onto the ground.  Oh, sorry.  I freeze myself for the future  out of the goodness of my heart,  and they, like, shoot slime at me?  Whatever.  I don't need their approval.  I'm gonna start some crazy biz, man.  Just watch.  My keys!


  I warned you. I can hear the crown's promise of power invading my brain. Destiny Gang!! Careful, there. Careful! You dankus! Oh, Simon. Aah! One more hit, and that baby's gonna burst! Ice lightning! Ah, Dingo. What's happening?! Bar-bar! I'll save you! Finn? Finn! Hey, guy, where's my buddy? Oh, when he wished for the Lich to have never existed Finn left my time room and entered his wish-altered reality. We can watch him on my TV wall. Oh Whoa. Alternate-wish-world Finn is mad uglies. Dang, I'm mad uglies, too! Everything looks nuts. Yes. Sometimes a well-intentioned wish can lead to nuts. But, you know, you get a wish, too. What?! Yep, totally. You can have anything you want. I wish for a sandwich! A sandwich? You're gonna waste your one wish on a sandwich? You don't want anything else? Nah, a sandwich is good. Maybe about this big. Or this big. On ciabatta bread, maybe? Hmm, I don't know. Whatever you got around. Your choice. Dude, I'll just make you a sandwich. You should use your wish on something important. You know, on someone who might need it? I'm talking about him over there. Oh. Oh! Finn? What what on Earth did this? I did this. No. That's not possible. I raised you better than that! It's true. I put out the fire! But I also made the bomb go off. The crown it compels me to ice up everything!! I'm sorry, mom. Dad. Little sibling. I'm too dangerous to be around. W-what are you doing? Take them far away, Bar-Bar. Leave me! Leave me. Looks like your friend is having a pretty rough time. Hmm, yeah. But, well, it's Finn's wish. Let's just see how it plays out. I got confidence in my boy. Besides, I'll hang on to my wish in case I need it. Aw! Don't worry, dude. I got you covered. They're homemade. I love you, Prismo. Oh! I'm serious, man. You're like a strong number 3 on my cool guys list. Oh, man, my dad used to make pickles. It's all he used to talk about. He'd obsess over them all the time. When I'd come in from playing, he'd be like "Here, Jake, try these." And they'd be pretty crunchy, actually. You'd think they'd be soft, but they weren't. I'd be like, "Wow, dad, you made these pretty good." Mmm. Yeah, that was dad. Rise, my wintry warriors. Tromo! Trami! Why am I cold and confused? Fear not, icicle child, for I have birthed you into a new life! Huh? The Mertens kid? An age of ice and whispering sno-o-ow! Hey! Cronk me loose, "T!" Come on! You see Big Destiny anywhere? Big D's chillin' over here, Wasteland style. Boss! Come back! Oww. Only I can protect y'all. Stay. Aah! My kicks! Can't you hear the The whispers? Forget Big D! Let's go! I've taught you well, my traitorous gang. Hmm? The voices, they tell me to freeze the world. Get off of me, weirdo! I am the end and the beginning. I am the hand of madness. Jake? Dude, I get out of relationships because I don't want to have a discussion about what we're gonna have for dinner every night. 'Cause when I'm alone, I can just sit on the couch till I'm hungry and eat whatever I want. It's not like, "What should we eat for breakfast? We should coordinate." That's a pain. Man, your view of relationships is very bleak. Don't you get lonely? I have friends. Hello, hello! Hey, so, I brought over the What is a singular doing in this realm? He's just here making a wish, cosmic owl. But I brought games. We were gonna hang. After. Come on. Get in here. Okay. Jake? Jake! I warned you, you butt. Whoa! Don't worry, Jake. I'll share the secrets of ice and snow with thee. The power of frost! The power of frost! The power of fr Three, two, one, go. We're three nice dudes, havin' fun. We got warm bubble water on our buns. I love this spa, and that's a fact. But if I stay too long, I get a "Pruney" back. Jake? Jake, what are you doing? Back off my crown, Jake! I warn you! Hey, man, I'm right here! That's not me, man! Finn! I'm in the spa bath! Oh, man. Maybe now you'd like to use your wish? Make Finn okay! I wish for safe Finn! Wait! Dude, look, I like you. So you should know my wishes always got an ironic twist to them. It's like a monkey's paw kind of thing. What? You just got to be really specific. Say your wish is, "I wish for a back rub." Who's gonna give it to you? A dirty man? A bear? And where does this "masseuse" come from? Do I zap some guy away from his family dinner? Leave some kid traumatized? "Mom, where did dad go?" "I don't know, son. He just disappeared from the table. Sorry." You see, Jake, there's rules to this stuff. Wishing an event to be changes elements before and after it. Memories will be destroyed. Babies will not be born. Potential worlds could be evaporated by your wish. Eww! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's a lot of pressure, man. Focus, Jake. Here, eat this egg. It's brain food. Okay. Okay. Think. Think. Okay, there is a way to bring back all life and get home. You just have to ch cha aaaa ange! The Li The lipstick! The Lich's Oh, the Lich's Wi ish. Change the Lich's wish! And go home. And go home! Okay. Okay, I wish the Lich's wish was for me Uh! and Finn to go back home to Ooo. I can work with that. All right. This has been nice. See you. I wish for the extinction of all li-i for Finn and Jake to go back home to Ooo. Huh? No, wait! That's not what I wish for! Sorry, guy, you only get one wish. Hey, Jake. Did you see that? Monkey's paw. Jake! What the Why would the Lich wish What? Jake? It worked! Jake! This is serious! Something really messed up is happening! It already happened! And it never happened! What?! What happened?! Nothing. 'Cause I saved everybody. Now, honey, I told you, you can take the sign off when you tell me where you hid Daddy's crown jewels. Wenk. Gunther! Huh? Oh-wowzers! What's that? Hmm! If you want to come back and hang out sometime, call me. "P." I got to get that guy a girlfriend.    This party is so crazy!


1  Hey, Cinnamon Bun.  Hi. I'm here on diplomatic business.  Yeah, the princess is expecting you.  Cinnamon Bun, welcome!  On behalf of the Fire Kingdom,  here's the get-well card for Hot Dog Princess.  Please pass it along to the next princess  after you've signed.  Understood.  Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo! I'm here!  Hey, Finn!  What's up, my main cinna-man!  Please deliver this card to the Slime Kingdom.  Will do, PB.  CB, keep up that smile.  Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!  Sit down, CB. Let's catch up.  Uh  I guess I can chat for a few seconds.  It seems like living in the Fire Kingdom  is doing you a lot of good.  Oh, I like it there a lot.  I have an important job. I have a wolf.  There's no other candy people, so that's weird.  Hmm.  Well, it was nice catching up.  Okay. Bye.  Oh, CB! You forgot your keys!  Hey, look who we have here!  Hey, guys.  Chet, you still make those awesome nachos?  You know it.  Crunchy, still chewing that same piece of gum?  Yep!  You still acting like a big goofball all the time?  Ha! I was a different guy back then.  Heh Very different.  Everyone watch! I'm gonna do a flip!  Whoa-oh-oh!  Oh! Oh, no!  Yi-yi-yi!  But now life is great.  It can't be easy for him,  living alone somewhere so different than home.  Princess?  Where are you?  Oh, hold on. Almost done.  I want to show you my newest creation.  I call her Bun Bun.  Hi! I'm Bun Bun!  Hey!  Is she like a little Cinnamon Bun clone?  I grew her from old CB experiments,  so maybe more like a third cousin?  Your mission is to take Bun Bun to the Fire Kingdom.  Yay!  I made you a new fire suit.  Bun Bun doesn't need one  since I engineered her to be fireproof.  So, how does it feel to be alive?  Um, it feels good, I think.  What's the opposite of good?  Bad. That's funny that you don't know that word  but you know the word "opposite."  What was that? Hm. I must be hungry.  Hun-gry?  Trail mix will fix this grumbling.  Here.  Have some.  Like this?  You're funny, Bun Bun.  Huh?  Bun Bun, chipmunks are eating your trail mix.  What are chipmunks?!  Look! I made friends!  Bun Bun, you're all right.  I'm all right!  Hey, Finn.  Make way for the princess!  Finn? What brings you here?  Special delivery for Cinnamon Bun.  Who's this?  I'm Bun Bun. Are you a chipmunk?  No.  Bubblegum made her from your spare parts.  She's supposed to be your squire or whatever.  My squire?  Hmm.  Bun Bun, we'll have to run you  through some security checks.  Okee! Turn around.  Jump back.  Jump forward.  Reach for the sky.  Reach!  She's clean.  Go have fun with your new friend, CB.  Come, squire!  I'll show you our beautiful palace.  All right, then. See ya.  Finn, wait. You don't have to just run off like that.  We can hang out if you've got time.  Really?  I have a light schedule today.  Hi! I'm Bun Bun!  Hiya! I'm Bun Bun!  This is the statue of the third Flame king.  Ooh, but that statue over there is bigger!  Yah! Yah! Yah!  Careful, Bun Bun!  Whoops.  Bun Bun!  Look! I'm king of the fireplace!  Behave yourself, Bun Bun!  Okay! I'm-a run this way now! I love you!  Um She's new.  Is something wrong with your coals?  No, they're fine.  It's just  When we broke up, I said sorry,  but I didn't fully understand exactly what I did wrong.  I get it now.  I shouldn't have manipulated you.  That was a really, really messed-up thing to do,  and I'm truly sorry.  You've grown up a lot, man.  I forgive you.  Awesome.  Bun Bun. Bun Bun Bun.  Ooh, what's in there?  That's where we keep the evil former king.  Yeah, we're not supposed to go in.  Bun Bun!  Hi, fire man. You look sad.  I don't get sad. I'm evil!  I'm just bored of this intense loneliness.  You want some mush?  Um  Who are you?  Bun Bun. Do you like dogs?  Sure, I like dogs.  Not those stupid tiny ones, though.  I like them medium-sized.  Oh! I like dogs! We're friends!  But I just met you.  First I'll need to know exactly how evil you are.  I'm 100% evil.  What's evil?  Now, what you're doing is really good.  Trying to make friends with the old king and all.  But there's one very, very important thing  that you need to promise me.  Yes.  You see that button over there?  Whatever you do  Button!  Well done, Bun Bun!  Now to the hills to regroup my forces!  Ha ha! I'm free!  Oh, my Glob.  Free! Free is good, right?  No, this is bad! We have to catch him.  Catch!  Oh! The Ice King!  Shelby.  Princess Bubblegum!  Okay. Who am I?  Pbht!  I practiced that one.  So, what else you been up to?  I started freestyle rapping.  What?!  Everyone says I'm good, but I can't tell  if they're just flattering me 'cause I'm king.  Right.  Fire man! Fire man!  Shh! This is serious!  Want to see me do a flip?  Wow.  Ohh-aaaah!  Bun Bun!  Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!  On to plotting our diabolical scheme.  Bun Bun, I hear the Flame King!  So, wearing your fire costumes, you'll pose  as a basket of orphans left on the castle doorstep.  They'll take you in.  And when they bring you to the king,  you bust out the water guns and seize control!  Any questions?  Are these your kids?  They're my army.  Your plan's not gonna work.  I know. I'm rusty at this war stuff.  You should do chipmunk stuff.  Is that what I am now? The chipmunk king?!  Uh I don't know.  Perhaps you're right.  I have no allies left in the Fire Kingdom.  And even if I did manage to steal it back,  I'd probably have to redecorate the whole castle.  Maybe I could stay here and rule.  Figurehead-style.  And I'll be the royal dog petter!  Would you really stay here with me  and my kingdom of adorable vermin?  Okay.  You're all right, Bun Bun.  All hail the chipmunk king!  All hail the chipmunk king!  All hail the chipmunk king!  Bun Bun, you're gonna do great here.  'Cause you're brilliant.  Thanks for helping me out.  Finn the human, he wears a bear hat Someday he'll be old and fat Unless he is immortal or a turtle 'Cause turtles always look old - Ohh! - Ohh!  Turtles got told by me, Phoebe Pure gold Guess who's back, it's Cinnamon Bun Bun Bun told me how to have fun again Also, she let out the old king What?!  It's okay. He's a in a chipmunk cave.  It's nice.  See?  Aww. Did Bun Bun draw that?  No.  We can't just let him run around though, right?  How do we know he won't moidle all those chipmunks?  No, he always did like animals.  I wonder if a new environment  might help bring out that softer side of him.  Being stuck in a lamp sure won't do it.  Let's leave him be.  "Dear Cinnamon Bun, I have a dog now.  His name is Cinnamon Bun.  Love, Bun Bun."

Not interested.  I think the reason I got all these guy friends and no boyfriend is because I don't really want to date any of 'em. I don't need to feel like I'm waiting to be noticed. I know who I am, and I'll know what I want if and when it ever comes along. But there is one guy I'd do anything to date The Ice King! What? Me, too. Ice King's the real deal.  Ice King is the hottest hottie, and I can't wait to marry him! ICE KING: said Fionna.

    Psst. Lemonhope. Hey, that's better. Who are you? My name's Phlannel Boxingday. And I've been watching you and your hard, hot life in this desert from up there in my cloud trawler. I thought you might need a hand. Mm-hmm. Kid, truth be told, you're looking a little raw. You're totally free to come hang out with me until you're feeling stronger. - Hmm. - It's your choice.  Let's go, dude. BOXINGDAY: So read any good books lately? Oh, I can't read. They tried to teach me in school, but I just faked it. Uh-huh. Uh-oh. Hold that thought, buddy. Looks like a Greed Lard's picked up our scent. Dang it! He's a fast one. We can't outrun him. But maybe we can drive him off. I need you to play that flute of yours, Lemonhope. I saw how you wrassled those scorpions before. Now play that flute with all your might. Keep it up, Lemonhope. It's working. He's turning off. -  No, wait. He -- he's mad. We've enraged him. He's calling his pack. The harp, Lemonhope. Quick, quick, quick.  We'll lure the beast into the rocks. No! Phlannel, stop the ship! Stop the ship! - What? What for? Stop the shi-i-i-i-p! You see, Lemonhope, it's not peeps. It's Dosh. - Oh. Greed Lards eat dosh for food. And 'cause we killed it, we get to keep it all. That's my job, Lemonhope. When I'm not out being free and having adventures, I'm killing monsters that eat dosh and then keeping the dosh. And it just so happens that I'm looking for a new apprentice. What do you think about partnering up with old Phlannel Boxingday? Oh, my gosh, Phlannel! Yes!  It's a dream come true!  A dream come true!  A dream come true! A dream come true!  Poor little Lemonhope Throw me a lemon rope ls there a home for me and my harp? A place where my friends give me hugs Hey. Hey, what's going on back there? Something don't feel right. Oh, hey! Lemonhope is here! Hey, man, how's it go-- whoa, what the heck?! -  - Run for it, Lemonhope! Run! Run! Come on! Why aren't you running?! Lemonh-o-o-o-pe! Morning, Lemonhope. Hey, is there any more white coal down in the hold? More black diamonds equals more love potions. The old three R's, you know what I'm saying? "R-R-Romance."  Oh, man, I can't wait for some lo-o-ve. It's been so lo-- oops! Oh. Rats. Oh, well. Hey, don't sweat it, buddy. It wasn't your fault. It's not that, Phlannel. I had a bad dream. Again? That's the third time this week.  I'm free now, Phlannel, to do all whatevs I ever wanted, but all I think about is my old life. What does it mean? Well, it's true you are free -- free to help the Lemon people or leave them be. But a debt unpaid is not easily forgotten, so you are a prisoner still in deinem kopf. Huh. That's what mistress always said, and I didn't even listen. Ah, Lemonhope, you're a doer, not a listener. You learn with your hands and heart, not your head. So, what will you do, Lemonhope? I'll -- I'll -- I'll go back, and I'll help my people- And maybe I'll feel better.  And how will you do it? Urn, with my harp and my flute! And help from my friend Phlannel! Ah, little Lemonhope. Of course I'll take you as far as I can, but I can't interfere directly in Lemongrab politics. All those old pacts and treaties have me sklonked up tighter than a synthetic zanoit sterilizer bed compressor tube enlarger on garbage day.  Lemonhope's family held in Lemongrab's lair Saving them will save me, but I am pretty scared Hmm LEMONGRAB: Looking for something? Well, you found me -- Fat Lemongrab!  Oh, what's that you've got? Oh, your little harp?! But what's this? I've got things in my ears tonight! So now I'm invincible! - Play it, Lemonhope! - What? Uh, uh, speak up, child. I didn't say anything. The harp! Hurry! I'll take care of the rest! What?! The harp, Lemonhope! Play it! Oh, the harp! Didn't I just explain? I've got things in my  My -- my -- my things! Let me go! Let me gooooo! The harp, Lemonhope! The harp! ALL:  Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! It's -- it's awful! Faster, Lemonhope!  Faster, Lemonhope! I can't stands no more! Faster!  Hmm?  Coming! Wait, wait, l-l-I'm -- I'm -- I'm coming! Ooh! Hello? H-Hello? BUBBLEGUM: You know, I was thinking, Lemonhope, maybe you'd like to stay here in Lemongrab while Lemongrab recovers. Every kingdom needs a champion, and you're a true champion if ever I've seen one. Plus I already set up a little room for you. Is he gonna stay like that? Like what? Oh!  No, no, no, no, no. Once his brain's and body's re-knit, he should be back to his lonely old self, which seems to be his only stable relationship model. M-M-M-Meee! So will you stay, Lemonhope, and help your people once more? Nah, that's okay. Oh. But I thought I mean, you guys are cool and all, but I mostly came back here so I could stop thinking about y'all all the time. I'll be back when I'm tired of being free. See you in a thousand years, I guess. Peace! Wow. I really thought he was gonna stay. Me, too. I even wrote a song about it.  - Hey, don't laugh. - Let me hear it.  No, it's terrible. Come on. - No! - Come on! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! BUBBLEGUM:  Okay, okay.  Young Lemonhope born from candy and glue Creator of beauty and ugliness, too Poor Lemonhope I found you in the dark You lived in the bathroom now live in our hearts Sweet Lemonhope freed by hard sacrifice to live in the kingdom of Sugar and Spice Lost Lemonhope longed for freedom above compassion or friendship wisdom or love Strong Lemonhope risking freedom and health came back for his brothers and for himself Safe Lemonhope No more will you roam Once you were lost And now you're back home   This party is so crazy!


     Ahh. Good morning, Breakfast Princesses.  Mmm!  Oh. Huh?! Oh. Sis, give me the phone. Oh, hey, Finn. I've got another Ice King situation here. Oh, yeah? That would be great. Thanks.  FINN: Ice King! How many times have we warned you about using love potion? That's why I'm using honey. Man, who cares if it's honey? You stink anyways.  Yeah, you stink so much, I'm gonna ground you for a week. What?! You can't do that! You're grounded for two weeks! You're grounded for two weeks! Three weeks. Oh, snaps! Why?! I didn't do anything! Four weeks?  Fine! But I'm only gonna do it for a week! That just grounded you for four weeks. Oh, dang!  Okay. What's up with the peace sign?! Oh. No, I-I was just trying to show you how many weeks you got. Get out of here, bubble butt! Awesome. ICE KING: Aaaaaaaaaaah! This is so unfair! They're the ones who should be grounded, not me! Ooh! I'm so mad I could just hit them! If only I could hit them without leaving the castle.  "HIT MAN" Ooh! Perfect. "Dear, Mr. Scorcher. I would like you to hit two people. Neat name, by the way. Love, the Ice King."  Aah! Whoa, you are fast! And quiet. ICE KING: And very good at dramatic silence. I like it. All right! So, how do we do this? Uh, we shake hands, or -- aah!  Oh-ho! Paperwork. "Finn and Jake."  Whoosh! Aha. There he is. Huh? What's he doing? What the I hired a hitman, not a fireman!  Dude, you see my masterpiece coming together, right? Mine's whack. Well, put some meat in there. Huh. What kind of meat is that? That's Meat Man's meat. Do you think it hurts Meat Man when he gives us his meat? I don't know. I can't read his mind. Phoo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! You guys, I -- What do you think "grounded" means?! It's wasted, man! Oh, great! Now see what you did to my buddy?! So help me, Ice King! Okay, okay. Ghal!  It's all right, buddy. We can make another. Sheesh, this Scorcher guy's got some weird ideas about hitting. Hey, there you are. What's that? I already signed that.  I thought I told you to hit them, not burn them alive, you big dummy! Ghal! It's almost like you want to kill them! ICE MAN: Lucky for them, I stopped the fire. You know what happens when you're burned alive?! Your eyeballs explode! Blah! Hey, wha?  Punch, punch. Punch. Rainicorn, don't eat him.  Ice winds, blow! Blo-o-o-o-o-o-o-w! Blo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-w! JAKE: Meat Man  Meat Man, I'm sorry, Meat Man. I-I didn't mean it, man.  Finn and Jake, I am just a dream! I was never here. Okay, mister, you are really trying my patience! How clear can I be?! All I want you to do is hit them -- on the shoulder, or something.  Are you even listening? Oh, I get it. Here's double the grease to not kill Finn and Jake. You trying to hustle me, Scorcher? Okay. I'll play this game. How about this prize piece for your pad?  I wanna live, live, live I wanna live, live, live  No-o-o-o-o-o-o! Huh. Okay. How about these bad boys -- night vision x-ray goggles for when you have a lady houseguest? Aw! Come on! ICE KING: At least renegotiate the target! You can destroy my least favorite princesses. What about Lumpy Space Princess?  Ghost Princess? I can't even hold her with my love mitts. Aw, geez! Uh  Huh. Oh! A-A leg cramp, in my leg! Ow, ow! O-Oh, this is so embarrassing. I'll be right back. Ow! Ow!  Think, baby. Come on. Ah! All right, let's hit the hitman, right? There's got to be a -- Ah! "Blastronaut --#1 solution for all hitman problems." Sheesh! $99.95?! That's nuts!  "Scor cher."  Sweet!  No! Come back, you wussy! Ooh, that was weird.  Was that your friend, or something?  Look! A supermodel! Look! A hoverboard! Look! The apocalypse! Someone got hit in the boingloings. Hit in the boingloings! ICE KING: Boingloings! Boingloings! Somebody got hit in them. Peace out!  Oh! Freakin' butt! Butt, butt, butt! Hey, Finn, are you awake yet?  I'm trying. I had a dream about Meat Man. Oh, yeah? I think I'm gonna stop eating Meat Man. Aah! Oh! You're grounded! I know, but shush!  Okay. I hired a guy to kill you by accident. BOTH: What?! I thought he was gonna just hit you in the gut and make you spit up your lunch. Well, I froze him in ice, but I think he's free now, 'cause he's made out of fire or he commands fire, maybe? Good job. Good job, The Ice King.  Oh, my life! Aah! Hyah! Come on, man! Let's get out of here!  Jake, do something! He's getting close! Yah! Go faster, man!  Oof!  You alive? Uh, I think so. Whew! That was close! Uh, hey, guys? I don't think this ice dome is gonna last long. What do we do? Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hm. Ooh! Got it! I'm gonna kill you guys. Hey, I'll kill you! No, wait a minute, you two! I won't actually kill you. I'm just gonna lower your body temperatures so you seem dead. And after we fool that fool outside, I'll warm you up -- good as new. No way, man! You already messed up enough stuff! You'll probably kill us, too! Yeah! We don't trust you! Zap!  You'll thank me later. Stop! Time out! You don't need to do this anymore! Look! They're dead! I killed them myself! Dead, dead, dead! Dead, dead, dead! They're dead. No pulses.  So, uh, looks like you can go home now.  Aah! Oh, yeah. O-Of course. There.  Oh, glad all that's over.  ICE KING: Hey, guys, guess what. You're grounded underneath my butt!   


  Kya! Kya! - Oh, that's pretty good. Kya! - Bmo! Keep it down! But you said 8:00 to 10:00 is my time to do karate. It's my karate time! I know, but I got a headache, and I'm in a funky mood. - What's wrong, dude? - I don't know. - I think I got restless-leg syndrome. - Is that from gettin' chubby? - What? No, man, it's just restless leg! - Oop! My bad. - What are you reading? - This old copy of Adventure Boy magazine. The only magazine for boy adventurers. This kid rusty is getting chased down the river by three grown otters. This magazine rules! - But I'm saving the end for tomorrow. - Cool! Well, I hope your leg feels better. I'm turning in. - I'll see you up there. - Pbht! - Jake. - No, Bmo. - Kya! No, Bmo! No more! Maybe some soup will take the edge off. - Bzzzt, bzzzt! - Ew! Gross! Nasty! - Bzzzt, bzzzt! - Hyah! - Bzzzt, bzzzt, bzzzt! I'm sorry you were born a fly and I had to kill you, you disgusting, disgusting creature. - Kya, kya, kya! - Bmo, please! Finn, was that you? Probably just Bmo or something. That's weird. Bmo doesn't like '30s jazz. Yeesh. Creepy. I didn't know we had one of those. Hey, hey! Hey, who? Hey, I killed you! Aah! - Ah! Ghost fly touching me! Finn! Finn! - Aah! - Ghost fly, man! Aah! Aah! - Okay. Come on, man. Let's get out of the house. It's a ghost fly! - So what? - No, man, ghost flies are filthy! They carry diseases such as tuberculosis, polio, dysentery. They leave those little fly doodies on your soul. Aah! - Finn, Jake! What's wrong? - Ghost fly! Thank goodness we lost him. He's gone. - Run! Just run! Oy! - Ai, ai, ai, ai! Hmm. Kya! Kya! We should ask what its unfinished business is. Ghosts always have unfinished business! Ghost fly, what's your problem? Come on, dude! Tell us your unfinished business. Ah! It's no good. He's a tortured little spirit. We need help to communicate with this ghost fly. Nah, man, let's just get someone to banish it. Someone with serious paranormal juice. - Is he coming soon? - I think so. His ways are kind of mysterious. That's cool! - Woo? - Let's get this ritual rolling. - I got stuff to do. - Woo! Hey! No! Unclean demon, feel the sting of holy water! Thank you. These circles will protect you from the ghost's attacks while I prepare the banishing ritual. Worry not, fellow believers, for in this bag, I possess all the darkest and most powerful tools of magic ever to be assembled in one place. We're perfectly safe As long as We Have Well, huh. How about that? No biggie. We'll just hang out inside these magic circles until morning. That's when ghosts go to sleep. Yep. Just got to make it. Till morning. The end of my story. And it's so close. - Don't do it, bro. It's a trap. - I know. It's an obvy trap. But wait! What if Watch this. Ha! - Mm? - Dude, what are you If I extend the circle Farther - I can get closer to the magazine. - Theoretically, that is possible. Yeah, but I'm still getting a "woo-jah" feeling. This seems like a bad idea. Just have to stay inside this circle! Haha! How'd you do it, Rusty? How'd you shake them otters? Man, what a great ending! Finn? What's wrong, buddy? Oh, Finn, you're disgusting! Aw, that's it! I've had it with this ghost fly! I wish I were a ghost - so I could punch him with my ghost fist! - Jake, I have a radical option. I've been studying a karate move that could temporarily stop your heart - long enough for you to fight the ghost on his own plane of existence. - What? - It's okay! I learned it out of a magazine. - Finn. All right. But first you got to give me some unfinished business - so I can come back as a ghost. - Tell me a joke. Okay. What do you call a bear that only attacks guys named Paul? Kya! - I killed Jake! Yay, Bmo! - Whoa! Bmo, you killed me. - Whoa. Wow. Wow! - Jake! I can't hear you! I will start your heart up in five minutes, okay? This many. Okay. Five minutes. Whoa! Is this some kind of low-level dead world? That's a bummer. Ah! Oh, stuff! Get away! Ah! You killed it! Aah! Aah! Get away! That's right. You never finished the soup. - That's your unfinished business! - Woo-hoo! And now that you've finished it, you get to ascend to a glorious new peaceful realm. Shouldn't have tried to kill me, son! Yes! What's happening? Oh, Bmo must be bringing me back. Yes! Yeah, Bmo! - Mm, Bmo? - Jake, I missed you, bro! - Jake! - Don't ever leave me again! Good job, Bmo! You brought me back. - Yes. Yay, Bmo! Bmo is so good! - Whew!


     FINN: oh, it's just my luck oh, it's just my luck I went on a walk and I found a truck oh, it's just my luck oh, it's just my luck when I honk this horn I'll wake Jake up Jake, wake up! I found a truck! JAKE: What? What's happening? JAKE: Whoa! Where did you get this baby? FINN: I found it in the woods. I named itHot Daniel. Anyway, I figure we can do some pretty sick stuff with it. JAKE: Oh, yeah? Like what? FINN: Mm, I don't know. Launch it off some ramps, maybe get it going 30 Miles per hour, crank the wheel into a gnar right-hander, spray dirt everywhere, like a big hirkin' dirt-wave. JAKE: Yeah, buddy! Nice! Let's crank this beast up! FINN: Can't. Engine's busted, I think. JAKE: Nuts. Bmo, you know anything about cars?  Nope. FINN: Hmm. Maybe Ice king, you know anything about cars?! ICE KING: Nope, not a car guy. Too confusing. Got better things to do with my life. FINN: Mm. JAKE: Wait, I know someone who's good with mechanics. Hey! Hey, guys! Hi! Hey! JAKE: Hey, banana man. Wow! I haven't seen you fellas since you destroyed my home, my land, and my rocket. FINN: Oh, geez, yeah. Sorry, banana man. Just sort of happened. Don't worry about it. Bygones. I'm just excited you called me over. We're neighbors. We should help each other out. I got the soda and the jams. ALL: Cool! I see the problem. The top of your engine is gone, specifically the cylinder head. FINN: Hmm. Okay. That word sounds cool. But what does it mean? Let me explain. The cylinder head is the top to the cylinder block. Think of the cylinder head as an airtight lid to your engine that regulates air, fuel, and exhaust. FINN: Okay, cool. Informative. What is he pointing at? Now, this lid is important because it works to get fuel into your engine.  You see, your engine has cylinders, and in these cylinders are pistons.  When the piston in the cylinder moves down, it creates a vacuum, pulling in fuel from the intake. You mean an air-fuel mixture? That's right, bmo. Have a gold star, dear. Yay! Bmo is so pretty and smart! Then the piston returns to the top, compressing the air-fuel mixture. Then, a spark plug fires off, creating an explosion, driving the piston back down, powering the engine.  FINN: Sweet. So where's the cylinder head, then? Hmm. Well, sometimes people store parts they are working on in the car. Ah! Bingo! Found it. FINN: Yeah! Drive time! Well, not quite. We don't know why they took the cylinder head off. It could be cracked, the gasket head could be warped, the rod bearings could have damage from water. You see, that's the cool thing about cars.  One tiny little thing messes everything else up, so nothing works. So it's up to us to figure it out! FINN: Cool. JAKE: Yeah, all right.  fixing a truck with the neighbors not a better way to spend some time hoping to see if they like me using automotive savvy do a good job they'll give me props  Bam!  I'm asked to come back tomorrow a future I see with them and me, best buds hanging out forever board-game Friday nights hanging out forever best-friend pillow fights hanging out forever board-game Friday nights hanging out forever best-friend pillow fights  JAKE: Whew! I'm bushed. You guys want to pick this up again in the morning? FINN: Sure. Sounds good. Not bmo. This grease monkey's torqued up on automotive science. Yeah, boyee! FINN: Okay, bmo. Good night, banana man. Have a good evening, gents.  Time for the night shift. It's 10 past the hour, and this is "graveyard shift," hosted by me, starchy the gravedigger, your weekly five-hour dose of all the strange haints, phantasmagoria, and phenomena I see workin' in the candy kingdom graveyard. Hello, caller. You're on the "graveyard shift." Wha-- am I -- oh, hi. Um, long-time listener, first-time caller. So, um, I think princess bubblegum has been replaced by, like, a lizard person. A lizard? Yeah, a lizard. I love your show! Oh, starchy's very interested in this topic. What led you to this discovery, caller? Ha! They are wrong! You look more like a hippo than a lizard. Well, um, my friend is a very highly placed official in the candy kingdom, and I've noticed -- hi, bmo. Yow! Stay back, lizard! Oh, sorry, bmo. I didn't mean to startle you. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the truck. And biodiesel! Oh! And I figured out what's wrong with the engine block. So, what are you working on? Aerodynamics. Swe-e-e-e-et. You know, it's been really nice hanging with you fellas and working on the car It gets a little lonely at my space-age banana dome. You don't have a girlfriend? No. I -- I don't want to be alone, but, uh I've gotten pretty good at it. I putter around the house, keeping busy with my little projects. But it would be nice to find someone. Hold up. Princess, is that you?  Oh, spooky. FINN: Yo, bmo, coffee. Thank you. FINN: Car looks nice, bmo. JAKE: Yeah.  Oh, aah! I fixed it! Are we best friends yet?! Oh. Oh, hey. I-I fixed it. FINN: Ni-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-ce. I discovered the cylinder head was warped, so I went to the junkyard and got a new one. Bingo. FINN: Whoo.  JAKE: Biodiesel!  ALL: Yeah!  Whoo-hoo! FINN: Awes-o-o-o-ome!  Yowee wow.  She's beautiful. JAKE: Well, then go over and talk to her! Yeah. Come on, banana man. You're lonely! Oh, no. That's okay. Having someone to love takes up time I could use to work on stuff. JAKE: That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Pardon me, miss. My friend here is super-smart, and he rebuilt this truck. He's very smart and very single. Okay JAKE: Anyway, his name is banana man. If you like what you see, give him a call.   BUBBLEGUM: Help m-e-e-e-e-e! FINN: We got to save bubblegum! No, finn! She's a lizard! JAKE: You got to stop listening to all those conspiracy shows. They twist up your noodle so you can't tell what's real. FINN: Look, there she is! BUBBLEGUM:  Whoa! JAKE: You want some tea? BUBBLEGUM:  Sure.  Thanks, Jake. FINN: So, what's up with the angry mob, pb? BUBBLEGUM:  They think I've been replaced with an evil lizard replicant. It's sheer nonsense. Eat this bug! Lizard!   FINN: Punch it, 'Nana man! Whoa, whoa, whoa! FINN: Hyah!  BUBBLEGUM: What the fridge? Whoa! BUBBLEGUM: Finn, Jake! Reptilian synthoid replicants are trying to take over the kingdom! FINN: Yeah, we know. Kill it! BUBBLEGUM: No! No! I'm the real one!  Hey, speedy. Unh! You're coming with me. What? Really? Mm-hmm. 'Cause you ain't got enough peel on that nanner. You're under arrest for public indecency! JAKE: Bye, banana man! It's not fair! BUBBLEGUM: It's okay, bmo. It's a very mild offense. It's not like that. Hot Daniel is dead! JAKE:  Loot, bro! FINN: Gear dumped, bro! How about this room, bro? JAKE: Looks like a brolicious room to relax in and play video gamesBro. FINN: Home sweet home, bro. ICE KING: Yeah, you said it. I've been home this whole time. JAKE:  I keep forgetting that he lives here now. FINN: Just until Gunther finishes rebuilding the ice kingdom. ICE KING: What y'all whispering about? Hee-hee! Ex-squeeze me. JAKE: Ice king, we've told you a thousand times. This couch ain't for cuddling. ICE KING: Sure it is. JAKE: It isn't! ICE KING: Mm, it's cozy. FINN: It's not that bad, Jake. ICE KING: See? JAKE:  Finn, can I speak to you in the kitchen? ICE KING: Oh, hey, Jake. Can you bring me a sandwich?  Sandwich? JAKE: It's time to kick ice king out! Huh! ICE KING: Don't forget the bread! Ha ha! FINN: Look, I hear you, but we can't kick him out because, well, I still feel guilty about junking up his crib. Hey, what if we check him into a hotel room? JAKE: Hmm. FINN: What's that? JAKE: Checking into a hotel room. ICE KING: Ooh, sandwich time!  FINN: Hey, Simon, how would you like to stay in the coolest hotel? JAKE: Lumpy space princess stays there. That's how cool it is.

(mouse squeaks) (penguins chirp) (screeches)  (humming) (buzzing) Bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz! The waffle doll shall fall, lest you eat the yellow dough! Bzzz! (humming) Hmm. I'll I'll finish this later. (yawns) I'm so tired! But also Hungry. Maybe I should Eat some (snoring) (moaning) (groans) Huh? Uh Huh! Hmm. Everything's made of Me. Pretty neat! I bet there's like Like a cool city or something around here. Nice! Jake cit-tay. - Hi! - Oh! Uh, hi! - Jake! - Huh? - How you doing, Jake? - Uh, good, man. Good. Man, this place is awesome! Oh! Cool dolls. They look like the rare, antique kind. Maybe my kids will like them. Hmm. Wonder what my kids are gonna have for dinner. Maybe pizza? (rumbling) Whoa! Whoa! (rumbling fades, stops) Some kind of Jake-quake. Eh? Is that Jake? - Hey, there Um - Come on, man! It's Goose! - Your best friend! Goose! - Oh! Uh Of course. - Goose! - Oh, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, ya big goof! How long's it been - Two, three years? - Let's see. Uh, one, two, uh I've never been here. (laughs) "I've never been here." You still got it, Jake. (laughs nervously) Come on! Let's get you home. Everybody's waiting - for you at the party. - Uh, party? No Par-taaaaay! (upbeat music plays, people cheering) Jake's here! Jake! (dance music plays) (laughs) Do it again, Goose! (grunting, slapping) (laughs) - Hey, Jake? - Hey, what? Now that you're back, how about that 5 bucks you still owe me? Uh, what 5 bucks? Cheeseburger cheesecake ring a bell? (rumbling) What (partygoers murmuring) What is that? Oh Oh, that! Don't worry about that. Do not. Don't worry about that. (thinking) Guess I better not worry about it. Hmm. - I'm hungies, Goose. - I think there's a leftover nacho basket or something in the fridge. (rumbling) Just a sec. Cold-cut-and-nacho sandwiches! (rumbling) All right! (slurping) Ahhhhh! Ow! Something's wrong, Goose. Jakey can't eat any of these nachos. (rumbling) But Jakey need nachos! Aaaaah! (knock on door) (british accent) Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake, the mayor wants to see you straightaway. All right, lad. Show me the way! (inhales) (panting) Jake! Hey, I got a for-real important question. Do you like cereal in your cake? Jake? Hmm. Mm-nn-mm. (panting) - Mr. Mayor? - Urchin. Thank you for your help. Help yourself to the herring cakes. Righto! Hello, Jake! Thanks for making it. - Heh. Okay. - Now, look, we're at orange alert here. - Below us are gathered the city's top minds. - Hmm. And they've noticed that our seismographic troubles have increased exponentially since your arrival. Mayor, uh, I want to meet these minds. - Here are some of the minds. - Jake, we want to perform some tests on you, to discover the cause of the quakes. There's no need. I got it figured out. The tremors are happening because Jake is hungry, and his stomach is growling, and the hungrier he gets, the worse the quakes will become! (laughter) - I'll prove it! - Huh? - Mention a food item. - Omelet! (rumbling) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's in the omelet? (rumbling) Chili! It's a four-egg chili omelet! (rumbling) (minds murmuring) - Aaaaah! - Watch out! - Analysis, Tim. - It's too early to say. - This evidence is anecdotal. - Look, just let me stretch outside to get something to eat, and the quakes will stop. - That doesn't sound very sciency. - No, but you have my - permission to test your idea. - I don't like that idea! - Huh? - If Jake leaves, that would mean the utter destruction of our world. I believe that Jake is an extra-dimensional being. A "glob," if you will. Whose psychic field holds our world together. If he leaves, his flesh will reconfigure, and everything and everyone here will disappear completely! Oh, Dr. Erik Addamkimson, you're just a fringe scientist, well known to have a crackpot of crazy theories. Hmph. Perhaps I am, and maybe I am wrong. But are you really willing to take that chance? - We should imprison Jake immediately! - What?! No way! The world's not gonna end just because I go get a bagel. (rumbling) Seize him! - Uh Peace! - Rah! Aaah! (grunting) - Why?! - Finish him! - Yaaaaah! - Oh! (whimpers) Bagel (rumbling) (crowd gasps) - This feels weird! - Don't worry, everybody. I will journey to Jake's glob world, which legend would have us believe lies beyond the great sky hole, and bring back the food of the globs to appease Jake's appetite, thus saving everybody. (crowd cheers) Wait! Wait! - I want to go with you, son. - I'm sorry, dad. You You can't. It's It's too dangerous. Your mind is unprepared. (crying) My son (sobs) (panting) (grunting) Huh? Yeah! There it is. The sky hole! Phew! (projector whirring) Oh, my stars! It's just as I envisioned. Oh, mighty Jake globs, I beseech your aid! Do you have bagels? Hello? Hmm. Maybe those aren't the true globs. Yeah, they're They're too ugly to be (slurping) (gasps) N-o-o-o-o-o! (sobbing) I thought you'd be beautiful, but you're not. (sobbing) You're hideous! Hideous! (sobbing) (slurping) Bmo, resume. Spaghetti (rumbling) (all screaming) Don't. (slapping) - Huh? - Huh? (both laughing) - Hey, you're hilario - Oh! Ugh! Huh! Ugh! (sighs) (grunts) - Goose?! - Go! But But what if Erik Addamkimson is right? What if you and all the Jake peeps disappear - and I can't bring you back? - Then you won't have to pay me - back that 5 bucks. - But - Ugh! Ugh! - Go eat, Jake! (inhales deeply) Huh! What is that? (all screaming) Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Uh Jake? What's going on, man? Feeling okay? Just getting a snack, Goose. Just getting a snack.


     Whoop! Huh? Oop! Whoopee. Cheers, Lumpy Space Princess.  JAKE: Yeah! Bouncing! Princess, this tea party sucks in a big way, but thanks for the invite. Oh, don't worry, Finn. The mallow tea ceremony takes years to master. Princess, l think l just now mastered it.  One more bounce. All right.  Tea-partying's hard, huh, Jake? Oof! Yes. What? No way. lt's super-easy. Lumpy Space Princess, you big faker. You're floating, not bouncing. Fine. l'll prove it. Huh? Aah! Oh, no! Oh, snap!  Aah! Ah, lame. Sorry l bit your leg. You're stlll biting me! Oh, my gosh. Oh, right. Sorry. Dude, your leg! JAKE: This is new. Nothing ominous, though -- just a bump. Nah -- that's no bump. lt's the early stage of the lumps. ls it serious? lt just means he's changing into a Lumpy Space guy, on account of my bite. lt's just like, um, you know, werewolf rules. Arrr! Arr-arr-arr! Arr! - Oh, no! - What? You think l'm gonna turn all lumpy, like her? Get outta here! Wha?! Finn, l think l'm freaking out! Calm down, bud. l'll l'll sock the lumpiness out of you. PRlNCESS: Hey, now.  Royal intervention. Surely there must be an antidote to the lumps. Yeah, there's an antidote, but you have to go all the way to Lumpy Space to get it, andJake has to use it by sunset. What happens if he doesn't take the antidote by sunset? He'll be lumpy, like, forever. LSP, please, can you tell us how to reach Lumpy Space? Yeah, l mean, there's a portal nearby. l can show you whenever. BOTH: Take us now! Take us now!  l should not have drank that much tea. Don't go telling everyone about this portal or whatever. lt's kind of a secret. Where is it? The portal is that frog and mushroom. Ribbit!

Aah! Whoa! Lumpy Space! So, where's the antidote? - Hold it. First, you should check out my house. lt's, like, kind of lame, but way less lame than, like, your house. Uh, can you skip to the part where you'll tell us where the antidote is? lt's up there at make-out point. That's so close! We can run there in no time. Aw, what?! lt's like a million-mile fall into space! Yeah, you have to travel by car in my world, or else you'll fall into the Lumpy Abyss. LUMPY SPACE KlNG: Daughter! Have you brought smooth people into our domain?! l had to, Dad. l'm trying to help them. So don't lumping yell at me! What did you say?! What did you just say?! l said, ''lump off, mom!'' - Uhh - What?! - Vroomvroom? - Oh, yeah, l need to borrow the car. You have made your mother cry for the last time, daughter! You are hereby banned from using the royal car! Shucks! l lumping hate them! l'm really, really sorry, Finn, but l can't help you, because my parents are horrible idiots! Don't you know anyone else with a car? My friend Melissa has a car, but she's dating my ex-boyfriend Brad. Call her now! Hmm. Call ''BBF 66.''  Hello? Hey, Melissa. What's up? - What's she saying? - l'm asking her! Geez! Melissa, just listen. MELlSSA: Have you forgotten what day this is? Melissa, l'm trying to help out some friends.

That was terrible! Finn, if you can't save me from the lumps, if l do turn, if l become lumpy like them, l want you to -- - lt's not gonna come to that! But if it does, l'll bury you beneath the nicest, most shadiest tree. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! l'm saying that if l go totally lumpy, then l want you to get used to lumpy Jake. What dld you thlnk l was saylng? Oh, um  Can't this car go any faster?! MELlSSA: We're already here. Hi, Finn. We've been here for, like, five minutes. Finally! Huh? This doesn't look like make-out point. This is Brad's house. You wanted a ride to make-out point? You think l want to make out with you?! Uhh Well, maybe l do, but wait! l have a boyfriend, Finn!  LSP, we got to hurry! Jake's running out of time! Hey, this is hard for me, too. l mean, l used to eat chili-cheese fries with Brad, so there's gonna be a lot of romantic tension on this ride. BRAD: Hey. Oh, Brad.  You miss me yet, LSP? Scooch over, Finn. l'm gonna sit in the back. This is it. Let's go. Wait. Watch yourself, Finn. The guys who use the antidote up here are notorious for being smooth posers. What does that mean? lt just means what it means. Hurry. Get the antidote so we can get out of here. Thanks, LSP. Bu-u-u-u-mps. Um bumps. Uh, yeah bumps. Aw, man!  Hey, guys. - Lookin' smooth. - Really? You think we're smooth? Well, mostly you in the center, but yeah. Why are you sucking up to us? My best friend needs an antidote for lumpiness. Yeah, lumpiness sucks. Hey, Monty, time's up, sphere hog. My turn.  So, the antidote is in that orb you were sitting on. This orb ls the antidote, brah. Can my friend borrow it? Yeah, sure, as long as you give it right back. Ham-a-cow! Thanks, fellas. What's taking so long? Did those smooth-heads give you the orb already or what? Wait! ls this another ''friend'' of yours? What do you care? Just give him the antidote already and stop being such a poser. Sorry, kid. We changed our minds. Why did you have to say all those rude things to them?! What? l was helping you. Thanks a lot! They were right about to hand over the antidote! You're welcome a lot. You insulted them, and they got mad, and now Jake's gonna be lumpy forever! This is all your fault! Wow. Now l know how you really feel. l was just trying to help, but whatever.  No. No, not ''whatever.''  l know l mess things up sometimes, but l'm really trying, and you're supposed to be my friend -- not like the fake ones l have here. So do what you want! l'm going to Promcoming! Are you coming or not, Lumpy Jake? No. Because no matter how messed-up and lumpy l get, thls guy never turns his back on me.  Oh, yeah. Right behind you. Just got to turn my back on this guy. Jake! lt's almost sunset! Jake -- didn't save him. l  l'll kill you, Lumpy Spa-a-a-ce! - MONTY: Jam on, man. - Huh? l thought you guys left. We were drawn back by your Plaintive Wail. We dig your directionless fury. Um, thanks. Respect. Here. Pyoo! Take it. Win your girl back. Yeah, there's no girl. But there ls still time to save Jake. Do you guys know where Promcoming is? Promcoming takes place way down on that land lump. FlNN: Awesome. Do any of y'all have wheels? Nah, we were all ditched here, just like you. Well, you think l could make it to that land lump if l jumped off this cliff? - You kidding? A smoothie like you will plummet right into the eternal void! What if l was lumpy? Could l float over? No, no! lt's too dangerous! l'd say there's a 50/50 chance of you making it. That's good enough for me. Now bite me! - Are you crazy, man?! - What are you talking about?! Raaaaaaah! Aaah! Aaah! Ooooh-- Yes! l can feel the multiple bites accelerating the lumpification process! l'm starting to float! Don't jump, guy! l have to -- for my buddy. Raaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wow. He's insane.  l made it! And there he is! Yeah, Promcoming. Yeah, cool. Jake, l'm mostly lumpy now, and l totally think you should sit on this sphere. - No! Hey! - Sit on it!  No! Please, Jake! You're my best friend! Just sit on the sphere! Pshaw! l remember you. You're just a smoothie- wannabe-lumpy poser. Sit on it! Before l turn completely lumpy! - No! - Oh, no! l can feel the lumpiness about to consume me!  Oh, yeah. Being lumpy is the best. Hey, stop talking to yourself, dumb guy. Take your ball and get out of here. Fine! l don't want you to have it anyways! So l can't have it now, eh?

You and Jake can make it up to me by dancing this last dance with me. Sounds good to me. What do you say, Jake?  That sounds totally lame. -  - I'm just kidding. Let's dance!

Well, why'd you capture six of them if you just want to marry one? l'm collecting them all first to be sure l make the right choice. You're both too young to understand, but marriage is a serious thing and lasts forever. You can't just rush into it, you know? lce King, don't do this. Just let the girls go. They don't want to be here. Of course they do! l would have killed them already if they didn't want to be here. Right, ladies?  Bzzt, bzzt. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Yes.  Don't worry, Princesses. l pledge that Jake and l will protect each and every one of you. And furthermore, l vow to see all of you happily married to whatever sweet thing y'all want to be married to. - Yay!  Rad! All l need is something to spear the lce King with. Binoculars, toothbrush, water bottle, rope, sweater, trail mix My flute!  Jah! My flute! Oh, nuts, dude. You broke it when we tried picking the lock to that sad ogre's heart. Darn it! Hee hee hee Hee hee hee Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee  Nice try, boy. Princesses, did you see? Did you see Finn fail? Don't worry, Finn. l'll get us out with key hand! Huh-ha! Oh, no, you won't.  Jake! Eat it. l'm -- l'm okay. lce King, you had better either set us free or come in here and fight me! 'Cause, otherwise, l'm gonna flip out! Aaah! Oh, are you trying to hit me? Well, excuse me, because l have to go potty in the bathroom.  lce King! Finn!  Huh? Jake! You all right? l'm fine, buddy. Calm down and tend to the Princesses. Oh, my gosh. l'm sorry, Princesses. Slime Princess, are you all right? He's held us here for weeks, questioning us about our favorite sports and quirky behavior. l tried to tell him as little as possible. l understand. And, Lumpy Space Princess, uh, how do you fare? - l'm bored. And l'm not having any fun. lCE KlNG: Wha-a-a-t? Not having any fun? Last night l read you the story of Baby What's-it and the Bottle Prince. That wasn't fun. That was lame. Other Princesses, do you feel the same way?  When you say ''lame,'' do you spell it l-a-m-e? Well, here, watch. l'll show you. We'll have some fun. Fun's my middle name.  Here, now, Wildberry Princess. l need you to play this. l don't know how. Well, come here. l'll teach you. Put your hands through the bars. Atta Princess. And do  l don't think l can. Just play it like l showed you. Leave her alone, lce King! Play it, or l'll squish you into juice!!  Oh, dear.  Yeah! Keep playing it. Now everyone pick up an instrument and play it. Oh, this is gonna be so fun!  What are you thinking, Finn? l've almost devised a plan. l'm gonna let him drum while l finalize the details in my mind. - Sweet!  Oh, that was fun! Hmm. Ah! lt was fun. Hey, you should go get some more fun stuff. You're right. lCE KlNG: Good idea, Finn. Good idea, indeed. lCE KlNG: l hope they think l'm fun. All right. l've got a plan for how to get out of here. First, everyone needs to be dancing and laughing and saying fun things like ''whoopee!'' Okay? When the lce King comes back, everyone play it up like we want him to come inside the jail and party with us. And then, when he steps inside, wham! -- l'm gonna beat the tar out of him with these while you all take care of Jake. Everyone on board with this? - Uh-huh. Sweet! Nice plan, dude! l think if everyone's saying ''Whoopee,'' the plan won't work 'cause he'll know we're fakin' it. Uh, good point, LSP. l'm gonna say something fun like, ''Oh, yeah, l'm having a fun time. Oh, my gosh. Probably the best time l've ever had in my entire life.'' lCE KlNG: Make way for the fun tray.  Whoa. What's happenin'? Oh, yeah. Oh. Probably the best time l've ever had in my entire life. Ha ha! So good! The most fun in the world! So good! What is this? We're having fun. Whoopee!  Because l left the room? Because they like it here. Because they like you. Because you're a really fun guy. l don't get this. He's not buying it. Dance harder. Come on in here and party. Want to dance with us, lce King? Come on! Really? You want to dance with me? Oh, yeah. Oh. Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Wow.  Okay! Yes! Yes! Whoopee!  Ohh! Wait. No!  Don't leave! l'll kill you all!  Ohh! Why are you doing this? Everyone was finally warming up to me. No! That is not the case! You're nuts, man! And l don't know how to help you, probably 'cause l'm just a simple dude. But maybe you should talk to someone with more life experience, like Jake. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Finn, what are you doing? Don't dump the lce King on me. But you've got to get it in your head, man -- putting Princesses in jail is wrong! Aah! Finn, you just ruined my chances with five or six potential wives!  For that, you will --  Ohh! Oh! Oh, my beard.   Why do people not like me? ls it because l'm a magic user? Or is my beard too shaggy?  l try so hard to be a good husband for girls. What's wrong with me?  Hoo! You're a sociopath. Who are you?  l know. You're probably a-a big nerd.  Why don't you try being cool like me? Whee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee! Oh, space dust is so ticklish.  Heh? What happened? Princesses? Ohhh!  Thank you for saving us, Finn. You're welcome, Slime Princess. And remember when you said you'd vow to marry us to the thing of our choosing?  Yes. Well  l'd like to marry you.  - Oh.  Yeah. Well, about that -- - Jake, help me! - Oh. UhSlime Princess, you shouldn't marry Finn. He pees his pants constantly, all the time. Ew! Oh, gross! Put me down! Put me down!  l'm sorry. Jake!  


     PRINCESS: Finn! Finn! Finn, where are you? I need you to try this. I'll be there in a sec.  What's the status? - Good, man. Nice. Seal the deal, bro.  Okay, man. Whatevs. You can do it! You hear me? I'm playin' Beemo. Call me later. Bye. How's Finn's date? I think it's goin' good. Unlike your game, boy-eeee. Where's the key to the tower, Beemo?! Tell me! Aaaah! Okay, Finn. She's 13. You're13. Just have fun. Be yourself. Whoooooooooooooop! What's that? Are you trying to make yourself Nah. This is an instant bath serum. It makes you sweat cleaning agents. I don't bathe. I want that.  Hot! So spice! So spice!  You're so spice! MANFRED:  Bwaa bwaa bwaa bwaa  Announcing the arrival of the Earl of Lemongrab!  Aah! Oooh!  This castle is in unacceptable condition! Unacceptable!  - For who? - Everyone in this room. Aah! Wait! Wait! You can't give orders like that! I'm in charge here, Lemongrab! Too young! Too young to rule the kingdom! Watch your manners with the princess! Hooooooooo! - What the huh? - Mm I am next in line to the throne, so I will be in charge until Princess Bubblegum turns 18 again! That's bunk! Right, Preebos? No. He is rightful ruler under kingdom law. It's complicated. I created Lemongrab.  He was the first one of my experiments gone wrong. Nyaaaaaaaaaaah! And now that I'm younger than him, he inherits the right to control the throne. If anyone needs me, I'll be taking a nap. And clean this place up, or dungeon! Three hours dungeon! Who are you talkin' to? -  - Three hours dungeon! Nooooo! We'll see you in a few hours. Okay, Starchy? - Yeah, right. If Starchy survives that long. Finn, this is dirt balls! We've got to do something to make him leave! Yeah! Like pranking him up his face! Yeah! And I have the perfect prank! Come on, Finn.  Huh? "You really smell like dog buns"?  Well, well, well. This is everyone, then? Yes. All the castle staff. So which one of you was it? Who did the thing?! The thing?  The thing! The thing! Hey, man! Calm down. It's just a prank, man. For laughs. Prank? For laughs? Yes, of course. Just a harmless prank for laughs. all of you -- dungeon. Seven years, no trials. -  Come on. Let's move it.  I don't think that worked out too math, Finn. What? No, no. He just needs some more prankings to finish the job. He'll leave the kingdom. Let's try it my way this time, okay? Okay.  Ooh!  Ha ha ha ha ha! Good one!  Keep 'em coming! I'm not going anywhere! Ho ha!  I got a new plan! Oh, yeah? What? We'll work together and use that serum you made, the one that was "Ah! So spice!" and spice-bomb him nonstop 'til his butt falls out. How's that sound? -  -  Thank you for releasing me from the dungeon early, Master Lemongrab. I determine what is early and what is late, Mr. Peppermint. Yes, your Earlness. Also, I don't know where food comes from. My lord, food comes from ma-- No! Da-da-da-da-da! No! That is why I am royal and you are servile! You ready to pour the stuff? Yeah. I made it super hot this time. Wait 'til he opens the lid. Behold, a plate of mashed carrots, flavor--  Shoot! Shh. Stop screaming! Why are you screaming?! Because I'm excited by this meal I made! Me, too. I'm excited, too.  BOTH: Whoa! He's eating the dirt. Spice it now!  Apple! Oh! Ooh! Mmm! Oop.  Mmm!  One million years dungeon!  Hmm. Maybe if we set his butt on fire? No, Finn. There's only one way. I just didn't want to have to do it. If I change myself back to my real age, I can reclaim the throne. What?! No! I mean, uh, you can do that? Then why did you wait so long? Because being 13 again is bloobalooby! Hmm? Well, being 18 is all plopdumps and waggle-sags. I never really get to act like a kid. But it's okay, really. My people need me, and that comes first. Yeah. The first thing we need is more candyflesh to increase my biomass. But I need my lab equipment to engineer it. PEPPERMINT BUTLER: Not necessarily, m'lady.  Oh, thank you! Thank you all! Okay, next we need a bonding agent. Princess, I think I can help. Finished! There's one last thing we need. Only the heat from a whopping love-hug can catalyze the re-agifying process. Are you ready, Princess? Yes, Finn, but first, I just want to say how much fun I've had hanging out with you. Me too! And I I wish I could stay like this with you, but I I know, Princess. 'Scuse me, Finn. Yo, Earl! EARL: What?! Hey! You're fired, ya butt! I'm so glad everything's back to normal. Thanks for all your help, Finn. Oh! You're welcome. But, um What is it, Finn? Well, do you, uh do you want to hug some more?  What? Finn, you silly. That was like five years ago. You really got to move on. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Such a silly boy. Hello. Hey, man. What's the status? Bad news, man. I I got dumped. Aw, I'm sorry, Finn. But look, man, let me share with you a little secret on how to win the heart of a princess. It's not easy, but you have to be persistent. You might have to defeat a demon lord and warp through several worlds, but once you do, you walk up the wizard stairs and produce your magic key you got in the water world and unlock the chamber door. Then walk right up to the princess and you give her a smooch.  Yes! Does that make sense? Yeah, man. I see what you're saying. Thanks, Jake. Mm-hmm.  Go up the wizard steps  


      Whew.  Finn! Finn! Oh, my grarsh. Finn, it was amazing! - Wha? I had a croak dream, Finn -- my croak dream! Oh my glob.  F-For real? With the cosmic owl and everything? Mm-hmm! Whoa. A real croak dream. Yeah, man. There was a rocket ship. You weren't there. And there was a Banana man. And I ran out of air in outer space.  Isn't that -- isn't that great, Finn? Yeah. Well, no. I mean, I don't want you to die. And where was I? I'm your best friend! Aw, come on, Finn! There's nothing to worry about. Think about it. I don't know any Banana man, and rocket ships haven't been reinvented yet. I'll probably live another hundred years, easy. Um yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess.  Someone's downstairs. I'll take a look. Pbbbbbbht! Who is it? It's the Banana man. Pbbbbbbht! Shh! What do we do? FINN: I don't know. Is he still out there?  Ah, no. He left. Phew. See? I told you today wasn't the day. Hey, you want to make an ice-cream pizza? Jake, your croak dream just gave us the upper hand. We can cheat now! We can cheat fate.  We'll track down that Banana man and crug up his schemes! And save you!  Finn, when I die, my individual Earth consciousness is gonna go all over everywhere while glob tallies my deeds. What? I'm gonna be all around you -- in your nose, in your dreams, in socks. I'll be a part of you and your Earth mind. It's gonna be great! Dude, stop saying all this crazy nonsense. It's making me messed up. I'm 13. You're messing me up. No one can change a croak dream, Finn, okay? Not even you. We'll see about that! Come on! Wait. Just let him walk a few more steps. Why? Because that idiot's about to walk right into the sun and burn up. And we'll be done with him. No, man, he's walking into his house. Oh, what? He built his house on the sun? This guy's insane! Finn, did you eat your breakfast? No. Why? Because you forgot how the sun works. The sun is actually far away. It's not sitting right on the horizon. Oh. Right on. Let's chase after him! You got to eat your breakfast, man. You need that protein. Helps your brain. Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say, mom. Let's go! Come on.  What's he doing with that glass?  Whoa. Just like in my dream!  Huh? Hmm.  Yeah! Here we go! Yo! Jake, stop talking about your croak dream. Makes me uncomfortable. Dude, just accept it. No, dude! What are you doing, man?! Aah! Hand me some leaves and twigs and stuff.  Hmm.  I blows.]  Aah! Wait! You're not gonna kill him, are you?! No, man! Just a warning shot, to scare him into moving far away from here! Hmm. Yeah! Look out! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!  Do it! Yeah! Oh. yeah!  Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Ha ha!  Yeah, baby! Move it! Moving it! Work it!  I'm gonna try and shoot this arrow again. Careful, man. I want to be alive for my croak. BANANA MAN: There's a move!  BOTH: Whoa!  Don't worry, Jake. We're gonna get this guy. Dude, man, I appreciate why you're doing this, but you're not gonna stop me from transcending into glob world. I'm gonna cry, man. If you say that one more time, I'm gonna let's go fetch that first arrow to reuse. 'Cause we're out of arrows.  Huh? Oh! The rocket from my croak dream! Oh, man. I guess I guess this is it. I've got to embrace destiny! Shushers! You're not getting on that rocket.  Jakel! You can't stop destiny, Finn! Jake!! No!!  Huh? No, man! Huh? What in the --  No! N-No! No! I-It's not ready yet!  Yeah!  No. Banana man! Get your butt on board! We've got a date with destiny! No! Get off! You can't mess with fate! No! I'm not gonna let you die! - Finn! - Don't do this! - Finn. - No! Finn. Let me go.  Please. Please. You have to let me go.  No. Please. Destiny!!  There's not enough boom-boom stick hole sticks in the stick hole! - Jake. - Take care, brother. You weren't by my side in my croak dream, but I'm glad you're here to see me off. That's right. I wasn't in his dream. That means  Ahh see you on the other side!  Huh?  Am I in glob world? Jake!  Jake, I'm coming with you!  Hey, don't try to stop me, Finn!  No, it's okay. I'm here to stay by your side. Thanks, man. I knew you'd come around.  Easy there, buddy.  I just wanted to borrow some sugar. Ooh!  Poor Banana man. So I guess that wasn't a real croak dream, after all. Didn't really come together quite right.  Yeah. Hey. So, wait. In the croak dream, it was just me and Banana man. But this time, you were here, too. So it must be destined to happen again when you're not around. Well, in that case, I'll just have to never leave your side ever again for the rest of our lives.  Hmm. What are you doing?  I can never leave your side ever again for the rest of our lives. Get off of me! - Rest of our lives! - No! FINN: I know where you live! JAKE: No! Come on! FINN: Whoo-oo-oo! Whoo-oo! JAKE: I know you're not a ghost, Finn! Stop chasing me! Yeah, ha! Whoo-hoo! Ha ha!  Ha ha! Wha! Yeah, ha ha!   


    Hour six of our Ice Kingdom stakeout. Abso-nothing's going on there. And if I do this hand position My boogers should turn into smoke bombs. Pbht! You sure this tip is good, Flambo? Come on. You know I'm on the level! The Ice King is scheming to nabs a Princess today! I swears it! FINN: Hm. Relax, restless-pants. A true Ninja can sense the intentions of his enemies. Jin!  Ninjas. Ninjas ain't real for nothin', nohow. Whoa, now. Ninjas are real. For, you see  Do-do-do!  Jake and I are Ninjas. Yep. Ever since we fished this Ninja manual out of a ditch. Finn, booty me!  Wenk. Listen! Wenk, wenk, wenk. Finn, I think I'm gonna take off my booties. I can't flip these pages. ICE KING: Ho-ho! Oh, Gunter, let's go. I've got the overnight bag. Wenk, wenk! It's the Ice King, all right, and he's looking awful pleased with himself. Uh-oh. If the Ice King's so happy, he must have stolen a Princess when we weren't looking somehow. That's Ninja logic. Then we got to -- - Ahem. We got to save that Princess. You got it, Shino-bro. Ninja kick. Ninja kick. Princess? Princess?  Princess? Princess?! Princess?! Uh No Princess here, man. No Princess?  It's A trap. We're being trapped! Ninja vanish! Evade, evade! Nothing is trapped, dude. We can't find any captured Princesses because the Ice King hasn't captured one yet. He's out doing it right now. Are you sure? No. It's only a Ninja hunch, so we should Ninja snoop for proof. Wait, man. I-I'd feel uncomfortable snooping through the Ice King's personal stuff. It feels sort of like A violation. Gah!  Whoo! Got the Ice King's diary. No, no, no, no, no. We can't read his private junk. And yet we must.  "Dear diary, and you better write me back this time. Today, I'm bringing home a special new cutie." There's our proof, man! Hmm. All right. Let's use our Ninja stealth and hide until he comes back with the Princess.  Or we could keep looking through his stuff -- You know, for more proof. He-he-he! No. Alls we're gonna do is lie in wait until the Ice King gets back. Then -- boom! -- We catch him with Princess on his hands.  Where are we gonna hide? In this filthy hamper! Think he's there yet? See anything? Nah. Hey, Finn, I don't want to hide in the hamper anymore. It reeks in here. But we're Ninjas, and this is our Ninja hideout. Nah, man. My sense of smell is like 1,000 times better than yours. Also, the hamper's boring. I'm out. Wait! I'm out! Jake! Get back here!  Hey, wait up! Check this out. Weird. I want to draw something. Hey, we got to leave no trace. Ninjas leave no trace. I'll delete it after. Hey, come on! Jake, what have we done? Aah! A secret hidden room full of Ninja stuff!  Oh, great. A line. Excuse me. Pardon me. UhI-I think you were actually Ahead of me. You know I was.  Counter maid, I demand medicinal attentions Preferably those of a Princessy type. And are you checking in as a patient or a cadaver? Hey! I'm as healthy as 10 old men! Wenk, wenk. Huh? Oh, oh, right. My penguin. He's very, very sick.  So, what time does your shift end? What kind of guy builds a cave inside of another cave? What's this? A spell book? Whoo! Dude! Leave no trace. Ah, it's too late for that. It's not too Late. Whoa! What you got there? Dude! It's a First-Edition Ice Ninja manual.  "True Ninja passes no wind. He only passes --" I ain't even heard of these techniques. Nuh-nuh-n-numm-nuh numb-chucks. Hey, Ice King seems way into Ninjas, even more than we are. Yeah. So? Oof! So, doesn't that mean that Ninjas must be kind of lame? Nah, they're still cool, but Ice King's still lame because he hides his Ninja love. We wear our Ninja on our sleeve! Jake! Show me how to do that.  What's taking that doctor so long?! Gunter, make more noise.  Yeah, all right, all right. Don't oversell it, Drama Queen. Dun-dun-dun! Pardon the intrusion. I'm Dr. Princess. Yes. Well, uh come to Ice King, Princess. Don't worry, Sir. I specialize in treating little tuxedo people. Just give it to me straight, Doc -- Am I gonna have to pay for this? Hmm. Wenk, wenk. Wenk, wenk. Wenk, wenk. Oh, my. What can you do for him, Dr. Princess? Without Gunter, I'll be all alone. You see, I'm a widower. Oh. I'm sorry. How did your wife die? Oh, uh, what? Is that what that means?  Whoa, Nellie! Something Medical is happening. Wenk! Gunter, you're embarrassing me! Frigidtsu Master Finn summons Dagger of chilled glass. Frigidtsu Master Jake summons Stars of frozen rain. Get ready to be Star-struck. Get ready to be Cold-cut. JAKE: Hyah! Kunai attack! Icicle kick! Force of blizzard! Flying jump! What?! Three Jakes? That's one too many. Caltrop hailstorm! Those Jakes were all fakes! Ha! Frigidtsu Master Jake summons Arrow of ice! Hyah! Rad! Oh-oh-oh-oh! It's the Ice King. Hide!  Do-do-do-do Ay-yoo-hoo-hoo  Okay, my dear, this enclosure will be your new home. He's got a Princess. Now we leap out, catch him red-handed. Hai! Snow-blind! Thin ice, thin ice, thin ice. But once you get used to the smell of penguin manure, it's almost tolerable. Hyah! Ice King, hand over that Princess! Hyah! Princess? What? Jake, where's the Princess? Ooh, right. What Princess? The, um, Princess you were just talking to. Yeah, the one you just came back from stealing. Wrong-o. I was at the hospital, for it turns out Gunter here was preggers! Wenk. I was just talking to the egg. It's such a cutie. Gunter's a woman?! What? No. Huh. Anyway, get out of my house or I'll kill you, et cetera. I want to take a nap in my easy chair. Aah! What happened to my recliner?! Oh. My skins and tubs!  You even violated my secret sanctum?! What is wrong with you? No Princess? No. No Princess. We messed up, Jake. We're Violators. Yeah, what the heck? You think you can just wreck my house and wear my collectibles?  Who do you guys think you are? We're Ninjas? You're not Ninjas. You're just a couple of jerks! It's true. Ice King, we're gonna make this right. Yeah, do it. Make it right. Start by, uh -- oh, take my bag over to the cage. Oh, no, no, no! Not that. Never mind. Uh, put that down and go clean my gym equipment.  Dr. Princess! Oh.  I have no idea how that got in there. What's going on? I'll field that one. The Ice King abducted me while I was distracted by the horrifying beauty of birth. Yes. Gunter's ailment was the perfect cover for stealing a Princess M.D. I'm not even a real Princess. Princess is just a surname. Enough! You may have uncovered my Princess-smuggling scheme, but you'll never leave this place alive! Ha ha! A couple of Ninjas like me and Finn can only be defeated by another Ninja!  Do-do-do!  Ninja! Ninja! What am I looking at here, exactly? Ninja! So, how's your egg doing? Wenk, wenk. Oh. Wenk, wenk. Gunter! Why didn't you tell me? We-we-wenk. Oh, gunter.  


Careful. You'll wreck my gift for Princess Bubblegum. Whoops. Hey, what's it supposed to be, anyway? It's a scale model of The Candy Kingdom, made out of my saliva. So, this means you want to give her your spit, huh? Yep. Hey, no! It's okay, dude. I totally get it. Ha ha ha! I just wanted to give her something, uh, to celebrate her science thing. You mean her super science barbecue?! You think it's sciencey enough for her? Relax. She'll love it. And then she'll love you. - Wha?! - Hey, there's Bubblegum. Hide it behind your back, man. Princess! Oh. Hi, guys. Just getting the grill cooking for tonight's BBQ. Oh. What's that you got behind your back there, Finny? Oh, I-I made you something. Really?! Can I scope it? Yes. Close your eyes. A'ight. Get ready to open your eyes? Ah-choo! Can I open my eyes? No, wait! Uh, keep them closed for like three more hours. I'm gonna open my eyes. Oh, Finn! It's pink! I love pink! Oh, thanks, Finn. Princess, Princess! Better not say nothing, you. Yes, Chet? Um, so, I called Grill-meister for the BBQ, but Pepper won't give up the spatula. Fine, fine. You can have it when you pry it from my cold, dead hands! N-o-o-o-o! Hey, if you two aren't watching the grill, then who's watching the grill?! Meat! Die, you fire! Finn, that was awesome. Oh. Thanks, Princess. I'm always happy to help. I see. Your heroic brain is fascinating in a scientific way. Many scientific minds are going to be speaking at my barbecue. You should talk about something, too. You'll do that for me, right? Anything you want. Thanks, Finn. Listen, I have to deal with this. See you tonight? Uh, yeah. Buddy, just breathe into me. Huh? You're just gonna give a speech to a bunch of brainiacs. I can't hang with those guys. I'm full of stupid. Then we'll just borrow some brains by going to the place where knowledge lives! Oh, Braintown. Uh, no, the library. The library of the undead. No, just the regular library. Hey, Finn, let's split. This turned out to be boring. But I have to cram this info. Okay, okay. I'll just keep reading this book about figs. And I'll just read this book about pigs. Ha ha! Whatcha doing? I'm bored now, too. Shh, hey! That's completely inappropriate. But -- but we were just enthusiastic about learning. Hmm. So, if I can't book-learn for beans, we'll just get some smarty to explain scientific junk to me. Yeah, then you can at least sound smart. But where you gonna find someone like that? Jake, we're going to college. And the great question endures. Who would win in a fight between Nietzsche's Ubermensch and Mandroid? The answer is Werewolf Queen. It's always Werewolf Queen. Rad! Jake, you can just shrink yourself down. Oh, yeah. And when I finally meet the Werewolf Queen, she will take me on as her royal consort, and we will rule in blood! Hey, teach, can you talk more about scientific, uh, stuff and things? Well, sure, I could if this wasn't a class on Theoretical Fight-onomics. Oh. Are you even in this class, Mister UhWormy Wormy McSquirmy. McSquirmy, huh? Well, we'll just see about that. Oh, there you are. W. Mcsquirmy. I'm sorry. Yes, you're registered, and you haven't shown up for a single class. Truancy hurts us all, McSquirmy. Hey! Ow! Please, where's your compassion? - Let's kill him. - Assail! Excelsior! Ohh! Aah! Jake, let's get out of here. Ow! And stay out of academia! Ugh! Well, that's it. I'm all out of ideas on how to learn this junk. Oh! Let's just solve this thing with magic. No. That's the easy way out. Yeah. It's the easy way out. Oh. Oh, yeah! Let's go visit Choose Goose and his magical shack. Magic, you say? Yeah, Choose Goose. I need magic -- some kind of mind-enhancing magic. Oh, yes, the quest that you are on requires the glasses of Nerdicon! So, I just put those on, and then I'd be able to give that lecture. And Princess Bubblegum will totally dig it. Yeah! What do you want for it, C.G.? Lately, I've been feeling drained. I only wish to be entertained. Hmm. Oh! Oh! Well done. The glasses you have won! Everything small is just a small version of something big! I understand everything! Whoa, bud, are you okay? Oh, Jake, I'm better than okay. I know exactly how to impress The Princess. - More spit bubbles? - No, no. Those spit bubbles were as fragile as my old perception of reality. But wait. Maybe you're onto something. I could show the Princess bubbles the likes of which no one has ever seen! And how will you do that? I'll start with a solid bulleted list. Thanks again to Dr. Dextrose for sharing your fascinating research on the future of cuteness. Yes, yes, how charming. What quaint notions. And now for a special guest lecture by one of Ooo's greatest heroes -- Finn, the human! Ladies and gentlemen and Princess, I'm here to talk about multidimensional bubbles. But I am not just going to talk about blowing bubbles. I'm going to blow your minds. Hmm? This is a bubble blower of my own design. With this, you can blow bubbles in different dimensions. This two-dimensional bubble casts a one-dimensional shadow. A three-dimensional bubble casts a two-dimensional shadow. A fourth-dimensional bubble casts a three-dimensional shadow. It is beyond comprehension! Beyond space! Beyond time! Finn, that would mean you've created -- Yes, a black hole! Whoa! Whoa! Finn, do something! It's okay. I'm sure the solution is on my bulleted list! Don't worry. I have everything under control. Under control?! My guests are terrified. Yes! And their brains are releasing adrenaline, dopamine, even dimethyltryptamine from the pineal gland! This has serious educational value. Thanatophobia and this N.D.E. is giving us euphoric altered awareness. Don't you see, Princess? We were all born to die! You're trying to kill us all? No, of course not. I'm trying to give you the greatest conference ever! Finn, you've gone insane. What?! No way. I'm, like, the smartest guy in Ooo, thanks to these glasses. Glasses? Finn, take those off. You're not yourself. - But -- - Please! I need the real you. What's going on? Whoa?! You blew it, Finn, with this. Then I'll kill it with this. Be careful. Finn! Look out! Wha? Fourth dimensional! Jake, let me go! Finn, don't do anything stupid! I can't help it, man. I'm all about stupid. Yeah! Finn! Finn, my science barbecue was a fiasco. That was incredible. That was the greatest conference ever! What's this? "Make hyper bubble, cause black hole, become insane, P.B. takes off the glasses, save the day, win the heart of the Princess"? Finn, you knew all this would happen? Huh? Knew what? I wrote that list when I was insane with smartness.


  Hmm? Gleebull baybelgrapes! You're just in time. Baybel cuber spoon to watch an incaldrible adventure from days of old on my holo-pyramid viewer. Five stories, each relating to one special theme. See if you Graybels can guess the theme by the end of the episode, okay? Now sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. All right, Beemo. We'll be back in an hour. You sure you don't need anything from the grocery kingdom? No, I don't need anything. Thank you. Okay, goodbye, Finn and Jake. Bye, Beemo. Yeah, see you later, Beemo. Finn? Jake? Well, hello there! Oh, hello. Who are you? My name is Football. What's yours? - I am Beemo. - Beemo, are you a robot? Oh, no, Football. I am a little living boy. Oh! That sounds wonderful, Beemo. Will you teach me about being alive? Yes, Football. Watch me. Oh! Pee-ing! Oh, Beemo! That's fantastic! Oh, thank you, Football! It's really nothing! What the? You see, man? I told you. This is nuts. Plus he's using my toothbrush. No, man that's my toothbrush. Ugh! "Prove that Beemo does weird junk when nobody is around." Check! High five, buddy! That was pretty weak. Yeah, I was thinkin' the same thing. - Give it another go? - Yeah. That was better. But we can do better. You mean even better! Let's back on up and run at each other. Okay. Ready? Go! Rrrrrr! Uhhhhhh! Yah! Ohh, it kind of stings. I like the pain. Let's do another one! Ready? Yeah! - Yaaaaaaah! - Whoooooooo! - Yaaaaaaaah! - Whooooooooo! - Jake! - Yeah? I know how we can do the most ultimate high five ever! You've gone crazy mad with power lust and I'm lovin' it! You ready to do this, dude? I've been ready this whole time, dude! Just waiting on you to say when you're Super ultimate high five, go! Gah! Whooooo! Waaaaaaaaaaah! Ugh! A glass of delicious nourishing water for milady. Ahh! Oh, yes! Mwah! Oh, man. Uh oh, boy.

Yeast on third, flour on first, swell the dough, fit to burst! Awoooooooooo! Well, this is it, Cinnamon Bun the most perfect sandwich that has ever existed or ever will exist within the confines of space-time. Will you do the honors? Okay. But but you you didn't you didn't even taste it! Thanks, Princess. Peace out. Whaaa! Blegh! Gunther, something stinks. Gunther, do you smell that? Gunther, stop playing the keyboard! Smells like it's coming from Gunther, are you blowing it up in here? You are nasty, Gunther. You got a nasty booty, mister! Nasty! Aw, don't be sad, stinky. Come with daddy and I'll make it all better. Goodbye, Gunther! Sorry, sweetie, but I'm never gonna get any princesses if you're stanking up the place! Blegh! It still stinks in here! What the heck?! Where's that smell coming from?! Oh, it's me. I smell horrible. Scrub, penguins! Scrub harder! We are not stopping until the stench is completely gone! Clean, clean, clean, cah-clean. Gunther! Guess what. It was me who was smelly, not you. Wenk. Sorry, I thought you had a stank booty, Gunther. My bad. Although I have no idea how my armpits got so stinky. Wahhhhhhh! Everyone's worthless at this talent show. I'm totally gonna win when I sing  These lumps I know you wanna slump up on these lumps But you can't 'cause you're a chump! A chu-u-u-u-u-mp!  You're totally gonna win, LSP. Thank you, Marc. You made 2 out of 10 baskets. Now it's time for me to kill it! Hold on, LSP. You're not up next. These girls are.  These lumps! I know you wanna slump up on these lumps! But you can't 'cause you're a chump! These lumps! So go on back home, back to your du-u-u-mp!  Wha?! That's my song! That sounds good in my eardrums! Waaaah!  These lumps I know you wanna slump up on these lumps  Hey! We just heard this song! Quit ripping off our act! No! I was gonna do it first! Rip-off! Rip-off! Rip-off! Rip-off! No! - Rip-off! No! I was gonna do the song first! Aah! Huh? - Whoa! - That's amazing! Huh? Aah! That was the most amazing thing ever! LSP wins! Really?! Oh, my gosh, you guys! I just want to thank y'all so much! It means so much to me, and I just wanted to say I I Finn and Jake win the talent show! What?! Awesome. That was awesome! Oh-ho! Baybel! That was easy, wasn't it? Slimmin'? I'm glad we all guessed the theme so easily! What? What's that? You haven't guessed it? Oh, I'm sorry. Well, pause your viewer now to think about it before I blable it to you. The theme was "The Five Senses." You see? Look Beemo saw his reflection. Finn and Jake touched their hands together. The Princess made a tasty sandwich. The blue guy smelled bad. And the other thing heard music. Ha ha! What a treat! Okay, well, I'll see you crimpy glimmers on triode flimpin' the diode! Ha ha!  


  What the? "Mmm, Princess Bubblegum, we are starving. Immediately send us all of your candy. How dare you. Ours, Lemongrabs." Bullgunk! I left them a lifetime supply of candy! Hey, Finn! Hey, Jake! Can you come up here? I have a job for you! - Okay! Sorry, CB, we'll finish this up later. Hey, "Preebs." Hey, guys, I got a letter from the Earls of Lemongrab. They've gone through all the food that I've sent them. This case contains precious candy seeds for the Lemongrabs to grow new food. So, I need you two to deliver these seeds to Lemon Castle. For sure, we'll do it. Good luck, gentlemen! Hup! Bye, girlfriend! Hey, Lemongrabs! You home? Holy! Jake-Jake-Jake-Jake! Oh, gross! No! Kiss it! Aah! Sorry, dudes, we got no food. No food. Hey! Uh! Hey! Weirdos! Get the birthday cake! Are you lemon? Whoa! What the thing is up with this guy? Does your head come to a nub? What? You are un-lemon. Yeah. Cool, man. Hey, do you know wh- I am Lemonjon. I see you made it past our lemon mmm "mmer-ringue-gerie." Wait. What? They're quite hungry. Yeah, what the heck's going on here? There is no food only lemons. Lemons with bellies empty but for their lemon lusts. Whatever, Lemonjon. We've got to give those dumb butts these seeds. Where should we go? Mmmmmmmmm My senses tell me that they're in the dungeon. They've been there for three weeks. Three weeks, dungeon. I wonder who put them in there? I don't know, but we gotta bust them out! Which way to the dungeon, Lemonjon? - Oh, cool. - Thanks, man! Yeah, thanks, man! Hmm! Hmm. Yo, lemonwipes! Euch. Uh, maybe we should hold hands for safety. Yeah, sure. So, where do you want to look ne Nyah! Uh, Finn?! Oh, sorry, dude! Stay close to me. Nope! Aah! I think this is it. All locked up. There they are! Hey, Lemongrabs, we're here! We're gonna get you out! Just hold tight! Go away. No food here. Maybe the kidnapper's in there, too, coercing them. It's probably the grossest one of all, too beet-red skin, barf, poopin' all its junk-sculpture. Ugh, stop it. You're just makin' it worse. Let's just get this over with. Lemongrabs, you are free! They broke the door! The door is broken now! Fix the door! Fix the door? What? What? Fix the door? Fix? What? What's going on here? "Fix the door?" Finn, what's going on? "Fix the door?" It doesn't matter anymore. There is no more candy to hoard. Let them keep what crumbs they find. For there are no crumbs.  Noo crummbbss!  Are you saying you locked yourselves down here with all the food so you could eat it yourselves? You know there's guys starvin' up there?! Mm, no, no. You do not understand. It is not us for whom they starve, but them. For whom they starve. Mm, yes, yes. For the candy food was not consumed. No, no. But was given life. Wha? You see, Finn when mother-princess last visited Lemongrab When she saw fit to create me Lemongrab She left behind a little something-something the secret formula for creating candy life. She must've meant for us to have it to keep making more family. Yes, yes, all her fault. What? What'd you say? I said all her fault. Oh! Indeed! For once we had commenced, how could we desist? I looked deep in myself and found that I'm a guy who can't stop making candy life from the food he needs. Me too. It just felt so pretty okay inside, greeting each new placid face And hearing each new piercing song.  We used the last of the food to make "Plop-Top" here. Hmm. I thought we said "Dump-Dome." Who cares anyway?! They've brought no food! We're all going to die! Look, we brought these seeds. They're special candy seeds. You can grow new food now. Oh, yes. Mmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, yes. Ooh. Yes, yes. There we go! We'll call you "Seed-Wad." Ooh. You really are gonna die. And all your boys, too. Our boys? Come on, we'll take you to see Princess Bubblegum. She knows more about candy than anyone. She built a whole kingdom out of candy. Yes, okay. For our boys. But first we will notify the children of our impending departure. So they won't worry about us while we're away. Okay, yes, the hard times are over. Here's the plan. We will go to the Candy Kingdom and take all their candy from them. Then we will give that candy precious life and build a candy army so we may then go forth and pillage candy for all to eat! - Now go, young Lemonjon! - Go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! What's going on, Lemongrabs?! - It's all your fault! - All your fault! We warned you! We warned you about us! Aaaaah! What the? Whoooooa! Jake, are you all right? Yeah, but look! He's heading right for the Candy Kingdom! And he's too big to duke it out with. Unless Giant poison candy aspirin. I've got this one, but it might be too small. No. We'll kick him in his heart 'til he's history. Those must've been Lemonjon's guts we saw before. His heart is his weak spot. Yeah, but we'll never find it again in time. Unless that's it there with the juice comin' out. Remember all that juice? From before? Oh, yeah, that's probably it. Whoa! Oh, man! Tastes like vitamins. Are you sure this is it? It's not even doing anything. Just smash it already, Grandma. Right. Oh, nice one, Jake. Whoa. Hold the phone. What is this powerful new juice coursing fromst my core source? Arrrrrgh! The juice aches! Is this the rumored ache of feeling? The feeling of caring unknown to lemons? New thoughts emerge If I act, the candy people will suffer If I don't, the lemon people will suffer. The greater good demands but one course only that I dissolve the bonds uniting me and become component to all! Oh, dang. He turned himself all up into lemon candy. Man, that Lemonjon's all right. And there we go. All done. The last trace of the candy-life formula is out of their heads. And I snatched this out the lemon castle, "boyee!" Now we all just have to keep a closer eye on these two so they don't get into any more trouble. But how come we don't just fix their hearts like we did with Lemonjon so they're more selfless and less selfish? Oh, no, no. Their hearts are fine. - They're just like this. - Mm.  


     - Good morning, Princess! - Aah! Finn, you scared me! I am sorry, Princess! What are you doing here, Finn? Since I got out of my last relationship, I've been slacking on the job. So I'm rededicating my life to protecting, serving, and meeting your every need. Jake said I was acting bananas about the whole thing and wanted no part of this. It's 5:30 in the morning. That's right, Princess. I'm getting back on the job hard-core, giving 100% of my being, all for you. Thank you. That's very nice. No need to thank me, PB. It's my job. Heh. Thank you. How am I doing at my job, Princess? Am I crushing it? Yes, but can you move just a bit? No, no, like out of the way. Oh! Okay, what else do I need? Aw, dang it. I forgot we're out of milk. Now I have to go get it fr B-B-B-B-Buh! I got it!  Hyah!  Milk. You wanted milk. Finn, I thought you went home. Yes. I do regret the slow return. But I assure you, this is the highest quality milk available.  It's mink's milk. I milked a mink. No limits to what I'd do for you. I'd throw Peppermint Butler off this balcony if you asked. Sorry, Peppermint Butler. Just joking, but kinda sorta not. You're really going over the top here. Take it easy. Princess' orders. Okay, I'll just rest here. No, no. Resting on the job is not resting. Go somewhere where you can relax. Yes, Princess.  Hyah! Princess, I give ma life to you, girl You are the best dang Princess in the whole wide world  Hup! Hup! Hup! Hmm. Wow, PB. Sure is a nice day to be outside. Hey, watch what you say about PB, bro! Talk garbage about PB one more time, bro see what happens! Hold on one sec, PB. I got to deal with a real tough guy over here.  You got one last chance to apologize before I dishonor you like you did m'lady. All right, bro, have it your way. Hyah! Where's your pants, bro?! Where's your honor now?! Everyone's laughing at your undies. It's real uncomfortable. What's up?! Heh. Whoa! Wowzers!  No! Did you drop this car on m'lady, bro?! Leave this dump now.  You dropped a car on m'lady, bro. Now I gotta restore her honor. Hope you're wearing underwear.  Huh? Uh! Whoa. Dude's got awesome powers. Hey, dude, you got awesome powers!  Ra-a-a-a-a-a-a-h!  You gonna kill me, bro? No instead I will pluck out your eyes with the point of my sword and whenever you try to see stuff, you will think only of me Rattleballs! Aaaah! Do it! I ain't a baby! Do it, bro-o-o-o!  You have a warrior's spirit  something I haven't seen in a long time. But your swordsmanship is pbht! You should learn to master your weapon before you draw it. What? You're just gonna tell me I'm terrible and walk away?! Teach me sword stuff, man! I know you're back there. I brought you a muffin. I don't eat muffins. I'm a robot.  Look, I know you don't know me and we got off on the wrong foot, but please, dude, teach me how to use the sword. Ple-e-e-ase.  - You okay? - No. When I was a young robot, I went horseback riding no one taught me how to post. The horse took a crazy jump, and I came down on the saddle hard. One of my gumballs bounced up inside me it's been lodged in a weird spot for years. Oh. Here Errr! Eh More to the left Getting closer Closer! Hoh! You got it!  Thank you! - Yeah. Perhaps you feel a sense of indebted obligation to me? Yes, I will teach you the sword stuff. Lesson one block my eggs. Yut. Yut. Ha! Got one!  Egg-cellent! Whoa! Ooh!  Ooh! Ooh! Yeah! That's right. I can take it. Yeaaaah!  You have done well today. You've felt the sting of the yolk, endured the sizzle of the mini BBQ. Perhaps you are ready to learn my secret technique. Secret technique! Watch.  What the?! The shadowless thrust. Your blade must be swift enough to slice the air between you and the target, removing all wind resistance. Now you try.  Again.  So, am I a master swordsman now? You will be, if you train this hard every day for 10 years And get a robot body. Oh. So, uh, why you livin' in this dump? You should be out in the world savin' fancy ladies and junk. That, my friend, is a long tale which I will tell you now. It was a much wilder time in the Candy Kingdom. I was a member of an elite robot police force created by Princess Bubblegum. Her previous attempts at law enforcement had been a bunch of goofs. Stop him! Go! Go! Go! Go! Our righteous swords cut a swath through the chaos. But we were too successful. Unfortunately, we were still programmed for violence.   Oh! One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two. Okay, robots, all the number ones go stand on that platform over there. And all the number twos just turn around and face the wall. And no peeking. RATTLEBALLS: We were programmed to follow her commands 100%. But through sheer force of will Nnnnnng! I was able to overcome it. We had been judged too dangerous to stay operational and sentenced to death. Number twos, chop, chop.  I alone escaped while my compatriots became minimalist furniture. Ah, sorry. I've lived as a fugitive in this junkyard ever since. That is why you must never tell Princess Bubblegum about me. If she ever found out she would have me destroyed. Rattleballs is still what?! He asked me not to tell you, but I could not break my oath to serve you m'lady, 100%. Captain Root Beer Guy, assemble my guard.  Hello, Princess. FINN: Sorry, Ree-B-Z. My oath to the Princess comes first. But once you two talk it out, she'll see you mean no harm. Banana guards, destroy! - So be it. - Wait! Cha-a-a-a-rge! Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Ugh! Cha-a-a-a-a-r  Rattleballs!  R. B., don't! You think I'm dangerous, Princess? Dang right I do! You killed all my banana guards! No, Princess, look! They're only bruised.  Hey, you hit me. I no longer crave mindless violence. I have found peace in meditation, gardening egg throwing. I hope time has also made you less bloodthirsty, Princess. But do with me as you will. In my heart, I still serve you TV: Bigger pimples mean bigger dimples, so mash up your mush BUBBLEGUM: Ahem Okay, everybody. I took care of Rattleballs. Ooh, wow. Cool. Show's back on. Everything's settled. I don't have to go back on my order, and you can protect the kingdom from the shadows. Thank you, Princess. That's marginally better than hiding in a dump.  Wait. - Hmm? - I dub thee Sir Rattleballs!    This party is so crazy!


      My GPS shows Finn and Jake over there. I think that's where the Ice King has them hostage.  I'm sure the boys are fine. The Ice King isn't usually a serious threat. Besides, this'll be easy with the two of us. We've got science on our side. KETTLE: Your tea is ready. Pouring. Pouring.  It's okay, Lady. Jake knows you love him.  Don't worry. Just try to relax. I'll work on my holo-entry. It's been three weeks since Finn and Jake disappeared while battling the Ice King. I've activated a secret GPS implanted in Finn's ear. It has led us to an uncharted black ice cave. But I've spent hours calculating every possible danger and am well-prepared.  Then I'll pull out my electrode gun.  Then I'll use my ball-blam-burgler-ber! Lady, it'll be fine. We've got science!   Hmm, I suppose that's true.  Let's roll.  Ugh, I can't get a signal in this chamber. Let's see if they show up on my heart monitor.  Hmm. There they are. Through this sphincter.   Hold up, Lady.  No, no, no!!  Aah! Aah!  Don't worry, Lady.  Ball-blam-burgler-bler-ber! My field of vision!  Hey! Lady, phase through the wall!  BUBBLEGUM: Come on. There's no turning back now. ICE KING: This is total bunk, you copier! You're only in love with her because Mn in love with her! Ice King. ICE KING: I've been playing this game a lot longer than you, pal! I've been working my moves, smooth-talking her, showing her magic tricks! Don't ignore me! Come back!  I'm picking up three heart signatures. Ice king must be talking to Finn and Jake.  BUBBLEGUM: Go to the right, Lady. Aah! Ugh! BOTH: Ew.  Lady! Lady, are you okay?  No, Lady, I won't leave you while you're hurt. Come on.  BUBBLEGUM: What are you playing at, Ice King?  Three heart signatures.  Getting closer.  Hey. -  - MAN: Princess. What a pleasant surprise. - Ricardio! - Yes, it is I. Did you find my dungeon stimulating?  Where are Finn and Jake?! What do you see in those two? A boy? And a dog? You deserve more mature companionship.  Poisoned with Zanoits! You see, I thought I only wanted your heart. But I was wrong. I was unfair to you. I want the full package. Princess - What? I'm a man now.  I made myself this body for you, Princess, synthesized from ice King's living tissue, his bones broken and reassembled. It hurt! Ooh, boy! How about a hug? Give me a hug! I need it!  - Silence, Simon! All for you, Princess. Now marvel at these powerful, articulate limbs! - Stop! Attached with supple and delicate sinews.  Lady! Now, my darling, we can finally be united as man and wife. Okay, Ricardio. I'll do it. I'll be your wife. - Ah! - If you can beat me at hand-to-hand combat! Oh, my! How Valkyrian! Princess, you are absolut- oh! You think we're intellectual equals? It only took me seconds to get you off your guard! And this "body" you designed is self-congratulatory garbage! See, I know a thing or two about building a body out of biomass, and you don?' leave your heart exposed! I just wanted to impress you. You didn't. Get out of my sight. Princess? Princess! Ricardio is back! He's in the black ice cave, and he's peacocking hardcore! I know. And he poisoned you both with Zanoits. But I took care of it. What happened? How did we get here? I dragged you all here on Lady's back. It took two days. And another day to make you guys an antidote. And 15 minutes to build the Ice King a new heart. Hey, Finn.  I made it out of Ricardio's sinews, and some toffee and maracas. Coochie-ooochie-coochie! I'm glad you guys are up. Please make the Ice King leave.  Shooka-shooka-shooka!  Ice King, please leave!!  How are you feeling, Lady?  Yes, he's awake. Oh, Lady, I should have never put you in danger. I saw on the heart monitor. I didn't know.  - Hee-hee-hee! - Jake! Lady! Oh, Lady!  I am pregnant! I'm puppies!? BUBBLEGUM: Okay. I'm going to lower the screen. Tell me what you see. Crunchy, you look like a rainbow. It's beautiful. Can you guys see that? Nope, only you can see it because you're hooked up to the aura visualizer. But actually, I'm lying. We can see everything you see on this screen. Now I'm gonna send that image into Crunchy. Whoa! The aura's gone. - Except - Whoa! Crunchy's true essence manifested in the material plane. I want to see Peppermint Butler's aura!  You don't want to see that. Yeah, we do! Right, Princess? Sure, Finn. Just let me recalibrate the device. No! Bunk that. I'm tired. Come on, Finn. Oh, yeah. Yeah, me and Jake, we got to peace out. BOTH: Goodnight.  Hey, what's going on in here? Yo, guys! BOTH: Hey, Finn. Whoa, what's that? Security cams? Yeah, man. You gotta see some crazy stu-- Yo, shut up! - Oh, shoot. - BOTH: What? Nothing. - BOTH: What is it? - BOTH: Nothing! BOTH: Show us now! BOTH: Show you what? BOTH: What you said! BOTH: We didn't say nothing! BOTH: It's too late for take backs! We practically know everything already! Now show us! Okay, but you can't tell anyone. Yeah, this is our weird secret. Of course, dude. All right. Now look at monitor three. Can you see it? Oh, yeah. That's uh Who is that? That's Chocoberry. Why you guys spying on Chocoberry? No, man. Look there, in the corner. - Who's that? - Zoom in, dude. Plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus --  Lemongrab! What the?! This is our weird secret, okay? Remember that.  How long has this been going on? He's shown up every night for the past two weeks. He goes to different rooms and just stands there. And you didn't tell me?! If we told you, then we knew you'd mess up our weird TV show. Banana guarding is boring. I'm gonna talk to him. Oh, no. You see? Sorry, guys. Lemongrab! Nyah! Why are you stalking my peeps?! I am within my rights! BUBBLEGUM: Yeah, but what are you doing? It's creeping me out. Uh, I am the Earl - Yeah? - The Earl of nothing!  Wait! What do you mean, "nothing"? Castle Lemongrab has no citizens! You have excess candies! You must donate. Dona-a-a-te! In your dreams, you freak. But you don't get along with others. I don't understand you, Lemongrab. No one -- no one understands! I am alone, and you made me like this. You made me! You made me! You're my glob! You're my gob! -  - What are we gonna do? Something totally bum slops. ALL:  No, no! We won't go! Please! Please!  All I need is three healthy volunteers to move in with Lemongrab. He's all by himself with no one to govern. ALL:  No, no! We won't go! No, no! We won't go! Come on, Mr. Cupcake. Just for a little while?  I can't, Princess. My arm is broken. Dude, you didn't have to do that. All right, what's it gonna take, people? CHILD'S VOICE: Two things, Princess.  Yeah, that's right. Back up, fools. You got nerve showing your faces here, Notorious Pup Gang. Bunch of bad apples. Back up, Finn. I'll take you out! We came out of hiding 'cause all y'all is scared of a Lemon man. And we ain't afraid, so we gots demands. And what is that? One -- total amnesty for past crimes committed by the Pup Gang. Hmm granted. Wait. They threw a basketball at my head one time. You gonna let that slide? We only did that 'cause you're old. You sacks! I'll rip your cups! Jake, please. What is your second demand? We want the big cash-money wad -- enough to provide for our delinquent mothers so that, hopefully, they'll show us the love we always dreamed about in our sad, young lives. Huh. I grant you the big cash-money wad! Now off with you to Castle Lemongrab! PUP GANG: Yo, Lemongrease. We're gonna live here at Lemongrabs now. Yes. I'm Jamaica, and this is Toughy and Blombo. Blombo, what is that? - What? - On Blombo's ears? That's his headphones. Blombo, take them off! Blombo! You must heed my instructions! Take off your things! Whoa, settle down, Lemongrease. I am not grease! This is unacceptable! What? What's going on? All unfit citizens of Lemongrab must be reconditioned! Man, are you crazy? Yo-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u! M-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e! I have to use my sound sword now!  You guys. What -- where are we? You are in my reconditioning chamber. You will receive four to three units of juice now. Ooh-ah! BUBBLEGUM:  Crunchy. Wake up, Crunchy Eh? Glob, is that you? No sign of Lemongrab for three days. I think it worked. Maybe. Let's keep looking.  BUBBLEGUM: Aw, geez. Hey! - Huh? What happened to your new citizens? They didn't understand my Lemonstylz. I like this way better. Hmm I wonder if maybe you don't understand their Candy stylz. Come on! Let me show you something.

His candy citizens! Let's crush this mess all accordingly! Crazy light-bulb freestyle! Yeah! BUBBLEGUM: No. He's my responsibility. I have to try to help him. - Okay, that's cool, too. - Hop on.

JAKE: Just an empty room with a Catcher's mitt. Weird. BOTH: Oh. Oh, no! Oh! Ah! Goonie-goo-goo-foofie!  Kooky-kooky-kooky! This is serious! Pup Gang got four units. Maybe maybe 10 units for trespassers!   You got tricks, huh? Got to fall down sometime, and when you do BUBBLEGUM: Lemongrab, stop! Huh? Please, Earl. I can help you. No! No! No more helping!

Take care, boys! Yes. Yes, indeed. Ha ha! A lemon gives by taking. And cares by yelling. - Hmm! - Hmm! Well, okay! Stop by anytime! But call first! Yes, goodbye!  


(mouse squeaks) (penguins chirp) (screeches)  (humming) (grunts) Asiago's like parm. (humming) Whoopsies. (blows) (chuckles) Okay, now easy does it. (splash) Ohh! (glass shatters) - (growls) Thanks a lot, dad! - Finn? What's going on? Is the spaghetti all Whoa! Finn, what happened?! I messed up the spaghetti, and then I got mad, and PB's candy arm exploded. (scoffs) Man, I knew that arm was bogus. Yeah, it wasn't the greatest. Sorry about the spaghetti, though. Man, don't worry about you just went through some outrageous beeswax with losing your favorite arm and et cetera. You can't expect to just bounce right back to normal. - I can't? - Nah, man! Listen. All these princesses donating all these gross fake arms They mean well, but they're throwing you off your game. You got to go at your own pace. If you listen deep in your melon heart (heart beating) That's where the real instructions are. My melon wants to punch my dad in the face and steal his arm. (laughs) Well, those things are bad, so they can't be the real instructions, but you keep listening. Me I'm gonna go to the spaghetti store and buy a new mop head. I'll be back soon. Just remember Listen to your melon heart. (sighs) Melon heart. Melon heart. Man, I don't know. It'd be so easy if I could just go find him My dad, that is. That portal he went through after ripping off my favorite arm went right to outer space. And outer space is up there somewhere I'm told. Maybe banana man could help me build a rocket or something, or some stairs or Something, Something, something. Or Or Or Wow, it's like a like a like a Like a magic Finn arm. (energy buzzing) She's powerful. You must've exploded the candy arm before and made the rock pile just now. It's almost like I'm trying to tell myself something, like a message from my melon heart. (humming) Jake! Jake! - Oh! I'm so glad you're here. - Afternoon, Princess. - What's that you're building? - Wait, you don't know? - I Might? - Here. Look. It was taped to the tower. "Jake, I'm going to space to punch my dad and steal his arm. - Back soon Finn." Wow, what the he?! - My biggest powerometer back at the castle was flipping all the way out. It looks like Finn somehow manifested a sort of telekinetic electro-emotional prosthesis. Word. Word. With this much raw power, he could be a danger to himself or others, so I've quarantined the area till I can coax him down. - Pbht! T.M.L.O., Princess! - What does that mean? "That means lay off." Finn's feeling this one out solo-style. Give the kid a chance. (whimpering)  Daddy's got an arm and baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad. Baby's building a tower into space, space is where he's gonna find his dad. Daddy's got an arm and  (chomp)  Baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad.  (whimpering)  Baby's building a tower into space, space is where he's gonna find his dad. Daddy's got an arm and baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad.  (shrieks) Oh! Hi. Get out of my house, or I'm gonna face bla-a-a-st you. Hi! (rumble, crackling) Whoa. Yep, yeah. I know you. You're one of those swimmers, right? - A real swim nut. - What? No. I'm Finn. Well, you can't swim in me Not anymore. I'm not water. - You can't get me up your nose. - Okay. I'm gonna keep going. I'm gonna keep going Into here.  Oh, baby's building a tower into space, space where he's gonna find his dad.  (hammer thumping) (blows) Good night, buddy! I'm proud of you! (whimpering) (birds chirping)  Baby's building a tower into space to tear off his dad's arm. From, like, where that round of the arm bone meets that weird flat bone at the top of the back Gonna pull that until it comes off Baby's building a tower of revenge  Hey, kid! It's me, again. Carroll. My name's Carroll. - Finn. - Finn, look, I'm sorry about blasting you yesterday. Hey, man Are you really gonna do those things? Uh Yeah. For revenge. I think it'll feel good. I get it. I get it. But let me tell you something I used to be water, like a pond or something real wet. I used to hate people swimming in me Kicking and stuff. So what did I do? I evaporated. I got myself out of there. You should've pulled off their legs. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen You have to stop obsessing about revenge. Hmph. Be like me and run away. You have to run away and never stop hating your old life. You got to really dwell on it. - Waaah! - What was that?! I just thought about my anxieties, it's like my mind-hand touched a hot memory stove. - Mm, waaah! - Interesting. Oh, hey, what are your thoughts on melon hearts? I don't know what you're talking about. Well, all right, then. I guess I'll see you later. (whistling) Hey, Jake. Where Where's Finn? Finn's just working some stuff out. And that's healthy! It'shy not healthy! It's bizarre, and he could get hurt! - Feelings hurt! - Yeah! - Yeah! - Ehh! (wheezing) Finn! Hey, what's it like up there?! I'm thinking I could turn into space ice or something. (wheezing) (warble!) (gasps) (wheezing) Dad! (groans) Oh, man! My nogmaster. Hello? Hel Oh! (stifled laugh) - Hey! Hey, dad. - Huh? Oh, good! You're awake. Mmm! Gotcha! (laughs) (creak!) Give Give it. Give me the Give me. Give it. (moaning) My my favorite arm. Oh, no! (sighs) Bu-u-u-tts. - Butts. - Didn't help much, did it? - No. Wait. What? - Bong, bong! - Sorry, buddy. - PB?! Wait, where am I? We're in the Candy Kingdom fallout shelter. I brought you here after you passed out on the tower. You were hallucinating like crazy, so it was really easy to trick you. I figured you'd thank me later after you learned your lesson. - Right. Right. - And look The arm is gone, too. - See? So, what do you think? - Mmm. (heart beating) Yeah, okay. Thanks, Princess. (snoring) (whimpers) Oh, hey, buddy, you're back. How you feeling? Um Neutral, I guess. I don't want to punch my dad anymore. Ha ha! That's great! You can always trust the old melon heart to get you through. So, I guess we won't be needing this thing anymore. - You want to do the honors? - Yes, I do. (rumbling) Aaah! My arm!


     JAKE: Beep! Beep! Look out. Beep! Beep! Pillow delivery. Beep! Beep! Look out, buddy! Ugh! - BMO: Ugh! - Come on, Jake. Sorry, buddy. I'm just trying to cheer you up some. I mean, here you are chilling with history's coolest friends, building an actual pillow fort, but you just sit there sulking. I'm like, "what gives?"  I guess I'm just thinking about Flame Princess. I told her a joke the other day, and she didn't even laugh or anything. Guess it's over between us. That's it? A joke? Maybe she just didn't get it yet. Yeah, right, BMO. More like she used up all her laughs at some other guy's jokes, probably. Man, having a girlfriend is hard. No, being crazy is hard. You're getting all hung up all hung up on imaginary problems. You got to focus on what's real, man. You see this cup? This is literally my favorite cup. Hunh! Now it's gone forever, so it's not real, and I don't care about it anymore.  Oh, no! My favorite window! I don't even know what you guys are talking about. I think I just need some alone time. Gotta let my mind fester a bit, you know? I'll be back in a little while. Finn, festering's always bad, man! There's no good kind of festering! Finn!! Man. This looks small from the outside. What's this, now? What the? Jake, what's in here?  Jake? Ugh! Oh, whoa.  Did Jake build this part, too? That guy needs some more girlfriends or something. Hey, Jake? You need more girlf What the? Door's gone? Hmmmmmm. Maybe there's another door in yonder pillow town. I don't get this at all. Aah! Dragon! Run! - Huh? - Oof! Hey, mister! You better get running! Blanket dragon!  Now, this, I understand. Bwaah! Oh. That's it? Wow!  Hey, uh how's it going? Hoy, there! I am Quilton, son of Pillowford. And you have saved our village! You and your sharp pillow.  It's nothing. I kill things all the time. Oh, nonsense! This calls for a celepillobration! Oh!  There you are, Finn the Human. Oh. Hey there. Um you can just call me Finn, if you want. All right, Finn. My name is Roselinen, daughter of Quilton. You have to call me the whole thing. Oh! U-Uhh  Just kidding.  Oh! Uh, your dad seems fun.  Oh, my! Puhzah!  Yeah. Um you want to dance? Oh! Well I have a girlfriend. Dummy, it's a dance, not marriage.  Yeah. Okay. This place is weird. Are you telling me that birds in your world don't poo little pillowcases? Nah just regular poo. Hey like this.  Yeah, i-it's really cool. Where I come from, I live with my best friend, who's my brother. And he's a dog.  We fight stuff. It's cool. It's really different than here. Um, where I'm from, blankets and pillows are used for bedding.  Well, they're used for that here, too.  Oh.  Pillightful! Aw, man. It's been nice, Roselinen, but I got to get back to my home. Quilton, I need your help to find the portal to my home world. Of course we will do our best to help you, Finn the Flesh Pillow, but you're not making a fold of sense. Please share our food. You need nourishment. It tastes like a pillow. I'll give your compliments to the pillow.  Oh. There you are. You found your mug. I thought you said you didn't care.  That mug is empty. I wonder what Finn's up to. Roar! I'm the blanket dragon! Well, I'm daddy! Sha-pow! Jay, Bonnie, I bet your daddy is just about finished chopping wool. You guys want to bring him his lunch? BOTH: Yes! Alphanumeric! Pillow Sheep, you have more fluff than sense. Mwah! BOTH: Daddy! Daddy!  What is this a pack of fearsome pillow goblins?  Daddy! We're your kids! Psst! Finn! They've brought you lunch. Oh, they have, have they? Tiny pillows. Mmm!  Darling, you've outdone yourself. Honk! Honk! BOTH: Grandpillow! What's my father doing here? Pbht! Oh, Puhoy! BOTH: Grandpillow! Grandpillow! Oh! Come here! But I've come to speak with your father. What is it, Quilton? When you first arrived here, you told us of a mysterious door that led you to our world. Yes. Of course. Archeologists found this in the pillow catacombs the Pillownomicon. Oh, my glob. There is no information about the door, save for the fact it shows up periodically and then disappears. Quilton, I need to find that door. Uhh hey, BMO, I-I gotta snag my mug from you. Oh. Really? Hey, don't sweat it. I'll make us some hot chocolate. Jake, you drive a hard burger. Hello? Ah, yes. Come in. Are these the great Abba-cadabra Mountains? And are you Rasheeta, the great Oracle, dweller of said mountains? Yes. And you must be Finn, the Human Man, seeker of the wandering portal. Yes. Yes, I-I've searched for decades. How did you know? I read it in the tea leaves. This newspaper I found from the future. Does it say how I get home? The real question is, are you sure you want to? Uhh yeah. Well, don't worry. You won't be here long.  So, there's another way to Oof! Not long now.  Ooh! Father! What did the oracle say, father? Have we come to the right spot finally? I think so, but the oracle spoke in riddles. Gonna have to fester on this one for a bit Oh, Finn. I know you have to go. All these years, I've known. But now that it's time  Oh, man. I'm just all messed up about it. Just promise me you'll remember us when you're back in your real life. Hmm. That reminds me, Roselinen, of something Jake told me just before I came to this world.  You're getting all hung up on imaginary problems. Stay with your new wife. You've known her longer now than any of us. You're not even sure I ever really existed. And I'm pretty sure I didn't look like this. Man. How did he see it all coming so clearly? Come on, everyone. Pack your things. We're going home.  Goodness, Jake. Why don't you do this with your other babies? Well, Rainicorn babies age rapidly. They don't need their parents a couple hours after they're born. That really stinks, huh? Mm  Hot chocolate is ready! ROSELINEN: Finn? Finn!  Wha where? Are you comfortable? I'm all right. Um Dad?  Dad, we just wanted to say that we  That we love you, Dad. I remember back when I was dad.  Dad, you are Dad. I ain't Dad yet! Oh. No. Wait! Here it comes! Oh! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, boy! Oh! Hup! Hey, buddy. You feeling better already? Huh? Oh. Uhh I don't know, man. I-I just had the number-one wildest dream. - Really? - Yeah! I was  Hello? Oh. Hey. Oh.  Yeah, thanks. Yeah, okay. Bye. That was Flame Princess. She said she didn't get my joke 'til just now and that it's really funny and awesome.  I knew it. Yeah, that's great, man. Now, what about this dream? What dream? The dream you were just talking about. - Huh? - Just a second ago. The dream you just had in the pillow fort! Pbht!  Come along with me And the butterflies and bees We can wander through the forest And do so as we please Come along with me To a cliff


1   When we catch that bandit, I'm gonna be like  Then I'm gonna give him just a wicked noogie,  then a lecture on personal responsibility.  Then another noogie, like,  "Get that knowledge in there."  Yeah, dude, but it's getting pretty late.  We might got to catch him tomorrow.  Aww.  What do you think, Finn Sword?  Should we stay out a little longer?  Should we do a sword trick? Is that a better idea?  No looking.  I bet you can't do that behind your back.  Like this?  Sword trick!  What a sword trick.  Finn Sword, are you just loving this?  Oh, oh!  I bet you can't do that and freestyle some bars.  I can do that!  Hyup!  It's the boy I-I'm a boy Whoa!  Aah! Finn Sword!  Oh, man.  Dude, we got to call it.  He's got to be around here somewhere.  Finn!  Finn!  See? Is that even an echo?  There's no way to tell.  Uh, swords don't talk.  Come on. We can find you a new sword.  We do that all the time.  You don't understand.  That sword is like me.  Like a sword me.  I don't think I'm totally scooping  what you're pooping.  I'll make you a new sword that looks like you.  We got a bun-ton of arts and crafts stuff  lying around at the house.  Yeah. Yeah.  That's that good-good.  Now kiss.  Mwah!  Pay it in the front, pay it in the back Pack that dollar in the dollar sack They call me badfoot money when I step in the street Huh? Someone there?  I must just be nervous.  Probably because I'm carrying around  these succulent money bags.  Got to go get these muchachos in a bank.  Aah! Please, I'm so rich!  Waking up screaming again.  - Jake! Jake! - Breakup? Lich?  Me dying? You dying? Other breakup?  Growing up? Never growing up?  - Or spiders? - It was a totally new nightmare.  I was in the woods and And I was gonna rob this guy.  Aw, that sounds like a nasty guilt dream.  Here, this'll cheer you up.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do!  Take a look at this!  Dooooo!  What's this now?  It's a sword just like your old one.  I couldn't get your mouth right.  Sorry.  Thanks, dude.  Yo, Finn!  Hey, Science Cat.  It's time for the daily brawl, remember?  I don't think I can make it today, guys.  But we came all the way here.  This is why Spearbear even owns a watch.  It's fight o'clock, Finn.  It's fight o'clock.  Okay, okay, I'll come down.  Aha!  Yah!  Bye, guys. Thanks for coming.  Science Cat: Your heart's not in it, Finn.  He's right, isn't he?  Did I take Finn Sword for granted?  Maybe I take a lot of people in my life for granted, you know?  Talking to inanimate object.  Get a load of this guy.  Hey, man, you're still up? Yeah.  I'm afraid of having another scary guilt dream.  Okay then. Let's stay up.  We can put on some up-tempo music,  and I'll set you up with a brainy modern video game.  Here you go, buddy. Have some tea. Thanks.  This'll be fun.  Like the opposite of a sleepover.  And I'll stay up with you all night if  Night, dude.  Hmm. "You kick open the chest.  It's a trap!  You've awakened the Demon Queen!  Fight the Demon Queen!  The Demon Queen cackles  and swats your arrows away"?  Modern games are so intense.  How do I check my stats?  Lady, you can't come in this bank.  My whole job is you can't come in this bank.  Oh, it is on.  Don't kill me.  I've never known true love.  Oh, my Glob!  I wasn't even asleep that time.  Jake!  I think Finn Sword is trapped  in the village of Spiky People.  - We got to go rescue him. - What?  Why come you know that?  That sword is me.  He's been sending me psychic Finnmails  of sadness and fear to my Finnbox.  We got to go save him. It's really important to me.  Aah!  Do you ever take those off?  Oh, Glob!  What happened to my peaceful world?!  It's Nacho Island Tuesday.  Nacho bros, can you hear me?!  It's Kurt, nacho bros!  - Stop! - Aah!  A talking sword?  I was keeping it on the DL,  but yeah, I'm Finn Mertens, a.k.a. Finn Sword,  a.k.a. sick of your non-irie antics.  You can't be using me to rob banks.  Hero use only.  Bandit Princess!  I, Cameron, mayor of Spiky Village,  along with the trustees of Spiky Village Bank  ask politely that you put our gold  back where you got it  in exchange for a pre-approved home loan  with 0% APR for the first six months,  and APR for the next 30 years.  Monthly processing fees apply.  What do you say?  You know what?  I just spoke to Ruby G, who owns the bank,  and he said that we can cut you a bigger break  on that loan.  I mean pfft! Of course, right?  How about we cut you a break, huh?  I'll be cutting and breaking you, Mr. Mayor.  Oh, no! I'm toast!  Aah!  OMG, you've ruined my life, Bandit Princess.  Mine, too.  You've trashed my hero streak.  And I'll keep trashing it over and over and over  until you can't remember  ever having done a good deed in your life.  Why would you do that?!  I was born with rabies  and my parents didn't love me because they both had mono,  so now I do stuff like this.  Call my wife!  This is terrible.  Oh, we're gonna do so many terrible things together.  It's gonna be hilarious to watch you cry, Finn Sword.  Cry as you end lives and steal from the week.  - Bandit Princess. - What?  I will find a way to kill you!  Hey, take a time out, dude.  We got a lot of lives to ruin.  Finn #2, if you can hear me,  this gray area wet wipe is using me against my will.  Please find me soon.  Find me and use me to slay this bleeble.  That's what I saw in my vision.  Finn and Jake, you've come in my time of need.  Sharon, what's going on here?  A princess of bandits stole our gold reserves,  and with a mighty sword,  she took off with my husband's head.  Mayor Cameron?! Mayor Cameron?!  You guys got swords.  Why didn't you do anything?  Well, this isn't a sword.  It's a massive hangnail.  I got one, too. It hurts.  Can you hear me, Mr. Mayor?  Can you sense where this bandit princess took your head?  Whoa!  We'll get your husband's head, Sharon.  And the gold, please.  You think he knows where he's going?  He made it seem that way.  Yeah, but maybe he's like a chicken  when, um When, you know.  When what? What happens to chickens?  Uh, I forget. Never mind.  Like our chicken Lorraine?  - Finn and Jake! - Whoa!  Thank you for escorting me back to my head.  Mr. Mayor, did you see where Bandit Princess went?  That way towards Box Kingdom.  - Let's close the gap, Jake. - You got it.  Good luck, you's two.  Oh, shoot!  Don't forget to bring back my gold!  Dag!  Sharon's gonna be real upset.  Gross!  Ha! ha!  Box Prince!  I'm gonna need all these boxes to store my gold.  Give up now or join your prince in the recycle bin.  Wait!  No recycling!  Hm. You looking for this, I suppose?  - You okay, buddy? - No, man.  This creep show made me prey on the innocent.  Ooh! This is freaking serious.  Jake, no matter what happens, don't step in.  Give me back myself, dude!  I'll slay you with your own body!  Give this tranch acute arthritis!  You gonna get bopped in the brain!  Dag! Useless. Eat it!  Finn! Stay put!  Hey, gimme that!  What the crease?  You gonna get it now, dude.  That's the grass sword!  Yah!  Aah!  Finn!  Hang on, man. I'll take care of this.  Keep your busted sword.  Pfft!  Jake, why does this thing happen to Finn?  BMO, it's a wooly bully world.  People be acting crazy always.  You mean some people are just  pure city sidewalk boom-boom from a rat donk  and that's all there is to it?  Um, I don't know for sure.  Here's the sticker I made of Finn's sword's face.  Thanks, BMO.  Yo, that's a spot-on drawing.  Did you notice I got the mouth just right?  Uh, yes, I did.  Come on. Let's get some air.  Okay, I like air.


There! Right there. Do you see? Uh, yeah. It's a small thing? Hey, do you have any bigger chairs? - Stools. - Huh? They're stools, not chairs. Well, can I have a bigger stool? Jake! Stop interrupting! Sorry. Enhance! - Huh? Hey! - Whoa, whoa, hey! - Whoa. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Looks like a mushroom. Is someone throwing mushrooms? Yes, very good! It is a mushroom, or a toadstool. That's why you're sitting on stools. - Oh. - Oh. See? You guys got to trust me, okay? I picked those stools for a reason. Trust my process. You can get up now. My legs. No. Nobody's throwing mushrooms. I believe they're flying on their own. That's where you two come in. Okay, the flying mushroom came from that direction, so I want you two to head that way until you find one A big one. And I want you to capture it and bring it back. - Why? - Huh? - Why? - Trust my process. Okay, but why, though? Yeah, we're curious. I want to ride it around instead of walking. I think people will respect me more. Hey! Hey, you, what's your name? I'm Dirt Beer Guy. What would you think if you saw me on a giant, flying mushroom? Boy, that'd really be somethin'. See? Don't fail on this one, boys. Don't you dare fail me. Actually, I'm kind of glad we're walking in this direction. We never walk in this direction. Hey, how long do you think capturing a flying mushroom takes? Well, we got to find one first. Yeah, that too. How long? Hmm. An hour to capture, and if we don't find one by dinner, we'll tell KOO to send out a banana guard patrol. Tell who? KOO. - King of Ooo? - Yeah. Did you notice he was wearing Princess Bubblegum's clothes? Yeah, that was sort of cool, but, you know, PB just left her kingdom to him and all her stuff, so what's that about? Hmm. I smell mushrooms. Yeah, good job, Jake! Check it out big enough for KOO's tiny heinie. Yeah. The only thing, though, is it's not flying. Hmm. Yeah. I guess we can just sit here and wait for it to fly? Canyon:  I know you are looking for a sea  - You hear that? - Yeah.  That lies beyond your reach  It's pretty.  But I'm hoping my heart can stop you  You want to go check it out? Mm, yeah.  I know you have places to go, I know that you want the sea but I'm hoping my heart will grow and that you'll come back to me  Oh, geez. Looks like some sort of old glob ritual. We should sneak away. We don't want to disturb. - Finn? - Canyon? - Canyon? - Jake! Finn? I mean, Canyon? Billy's ex! How are ya? Sorry we interrupted your sacred ritual. Oh, no, I was just procrastinating. What are you guys doing? We're on an official mission for the princess. - Nothing! - Cool! That's really cool. What are you doing, Canyon? Oh, I'm using this dowsing rod to find my family's lost sacred spring. - Cool! - Whoa! You guys want to help? - Uh - Yeah! Wait, Jake, what about Dude, have you ever taken a sip from a sacred spring? It's the boo boo best. Plus, you know I've always wanted to learn how to use a dowsing rod. Mm, okay. All right! There you go. Just hold it like you would a butterfly. - You got it? - Yeah. Whoa. It's going nuts! It works! King of Ooo: Finn? Jake? You boys there? Uh, hey, what's up, KOO? - What? - I mean, King of Ooo. What's up? Princess King of Ooo. What's up? Just checking in on your progress. Have you found a flying mushroom big enough to sit on? Have you captured it? - Uh - Uh - Uh - Uh - Uh - Uh - Uh - Uh Psst! Jake! King of Ooo: What's going on? Who's that saying "psst"? Oh, look at that! Yes. That's right. Finn! Tame that wild beast. I don't want it bucking me off now. Yes. See you soon, boys. That was dope! That's who's running the Candy Kingdom now? What a tool. - Mm. - What's the matter, dude? I don't know, man. We're disobeying royal orders. Is that bad, maybe? KOO probs will forget about this whole mushroom thing in a day or two. And if you don't like your job, it might be time to find a new one. Hmm. Huh? Whoa! What the It's some kind of mega-mush. Ha! Cool! Mega-mush! Mega-mush! Mega-mush! Whoa. Calm down, buddy. This is a fake mush. See? Whoop! Whoa! In here! What the donk, man? Hmm. Those looked like spore-dispersing blasts. I'd say a bunch of mushrooms joined into a next-level flying super-organism. They're gonna rule the school. I'm just guessing, though, but it sounds plausible, right? What you think it tastes like? Tra-a-a-apped. Maybe we can wait him out. Hey, yeah! Maybe it's already gone! Boop! Looks like the co Yeah, no, he's still out there. I'm gonna go out there and talk to it. Maybe it can be reasoned with. This could just be a big mush-understanding. Hey, buddy. Whoa, whoa. Times! I call times! We're sorry about earlier. We goofed up. There's no way our fake mushroom could come close to your level of beauty. It's true. You're stunning. Oh, glob, no! U-uh I mean I am an excellent source of vitamin B, copper, and zinc! Uh, congrats? Yeek! Hey, now! That was poor sportsmans Whoa! Mid-joke? You monster. If you combine me with yeast and ferment me, I'll form a healthy tea called kombucha. The health benefi Aah! Yah! - Shing! - Hyup! Finn: Mushroom chop! Whoa! Ugh! The health benefits of kombucha have not been confirmed by scientific research. We're learning a lot about mushrooms today. Ugh. They're in my sinuses. Yoink. In fact, drinking kombucha has been linked in rare cases to serious side effects. Ugh. That was dumb. Canyon, your dowsing rod! Dude. The sacred spring. Mushrooms are gentle. To clean me, wipe me with a damp paper towel. Whoa! Hyaaaahhh! Yahhhhh! Canyon, you're so cool. My chromophores can be used to dye wool and other natural Farewell, mega-mush. May we meet again in your next incarnation. Cute. This was fun, Canyon. Yep. I found the sacred spring, and we exterminated the flying mushroom infestation. Mission complete. Yeah. Oh. Hmm. That wasn't actually our mission. King of Ooo: All right, boys, let's see it. Fair Princess of Ooo, we were unable to procure a flying mushroom, so instead, may we present an advanced mushroom pizza! It's not as you ordered, my liege But this pizza can probably fly if you believe hard enough. Ooh! A delightful pizza-ah! Well, then, you two are fired! - What?? - Whaaaaat? You have defied the order of your princess. Henceforth, you are banished from my royal guard. We don't even like you Hup-hup-hup. Spare me your groveling. You're fired. Shoo, shoo. Ooh! Hmm. Hmmmm. Yeeees! I can feel it working! Banana guards! Hup, hup, hup, hup. - Give me a push! - Yahhhh! I'm flyyyy Eeeh. Wha Uh. Uh, uh? Mama?

And even though he is gone and it's super sad, I would like to honor James With this new James I whipped up in the lab! - Jeet! - Here you go, James. An award for bravery. Let's hear it for James! Wow, James sacrificed his life for you again, PB. Yeah, that's like the 25th time, right? Obviously, you'll have to re-clone him. - Totes. - No, hold up. This ground is perfectly solid. - There's no loose gravel here. - So what? Clone him up, girl. James is too reckless. I can't reward this kind of foolish behavior forever. It's time James takes his eternal nap. - But it's James! - Come on, P-Bog! Don't be all cold-hearty! I'm putting my foot down. There will be no more Jameses. - No. - I'm sorry. Look, I need you guys to go to James' apartment and box up his stuff. And remember the time James saved PB from that contaminated cupcake? Yeah. He ate that whole cupcake. What a guy! Is this James heaven? Jameses! All right. Who's in charge here? - James. - Um, I'm James number two. The original James got all goopy in the desert. Explain this biz, James II. Well, I was lonely! I knew Princess Bubs would make a new James if, you know If James died a hero. So - You faked your own death? - Yeah. I just wanted a friend, someone who gets me! Vrrt. Beoop. - James! - Plus, each time I get Kerplonked, I get another shiny medal. And why have two medals when you can have all the medals?! Medals, medals, medals!

How could one picture identify 25 perpetrators? It's because they all look the same. Oh, okay. I see. There's 25 of them! - They all look like this guy! - Uh, how can 25 guys look like one guy? - You mean they're vigintiquintuplets? - You mean they're vigintiquintuplets? No. They're clones. - What are clones? - A group of organisms or cells produced asexually from one ancestor or stock to which they are genetically identical. - How did that happen? - It's a long story. - I love long stories. - Gah! - There's no time! - And they're not brothers? No, they're not brothers. They're clones! Hey! Get down here and help me! Vigintiquintuplets, I'm telling you What are you doing? Why aren't you helping? Come on, Peebs!

What's your name? - James. - What's your name? - James. - James. - James. - You're all named James. - Is it because you guys look alike? - I guess so. You know, I was telling this to the guys. If if we look alike, we should just have the same name. It would just make it a little easier life, that is. It would make life A little easier. Uh, give me a second. Same name, look alike. You really look alike. Brothers! You're all brothers?! - No, I don't think so. - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven of us look alike, there's 25. Hmm. 25 Not brothers No, they're not brothers.

I-I came here with no self-esteem and no chances, a willow wisp of a boy, but I walk out of this arena a man, a confident man who deserves a kiss from a Princess!   No-o-o-o-o-o!! It appears you have knocked out Abracadaniel using the most shameful of all magic, a power shriek.  But since you are the last wizard, you are the winner of Wizard Battle!  Go get ready for your kiss, champ. Wow, man! What? I never heard you scream like that before. You were all like, "No-o-o-o-o! No one kisses her but me-e-e-e!" Yeah, okay, I want to kiss her, all right? You got me! The big secret is out! Okay, Jake! I like Princess Bubblegum! Are you happy, Jake?! Whoa. Jake, don't cry, man. I'm not really mad at you.

And -- and we  I dishonored Wizard Battle. Oh, Finn, you did all that for me?  That's for being sweet  and that's for cheating. Finn, you know better than to ruin the sanctity of Wizard Battle!

  Hello? Whew. Ooh. Whew. Ugh. Oh. Beemo? Beemo? Beemo, are you okay? What did you do? It wasn't me. I didn't do noth do noth do nothing. Come on, Beemo, we gotta get you to the hospital or whatevs. No, no. I am fine. Really. Oh, yes. Okay. Please take me to get fixed. I need need need need to get new core system drivers installed. We can get them at the Mo Factory in the Badlands where I was born. The Mo Factory? Yeah, I'm programmed with emergency instructions to get there. Come on, there's no no no no no time to lo lo lo lo lose. Okay, now straight down this place. Okay, now take a ri ri ri ri left up here. The instructions also say that damaged Mos get a full memory wipe before repairs. Don't let on what happened, or all the years we've spent together they'll vanish like tears in the oven. Tears in the oven? But memories are real, real cruesch. Yeah, no fooling. Oh, wait, there's more. It says here only Mos are allowed in the factory. Wait, what? Oh, that's just great. Hey, hey, don't worry, buddy. We're Finn and Jake, remember? Or should I say, "Finn and JMo"? Wow. Hey, Beemo, check this out, too. Meet FMo. Finn, you dumb you dumb you dumb you da man. This is gonna be a snap! Hello, there. Greetings and welcome to Mo-Co. I am Deemo. Please state your business. Hey, there, Deemo. I am J-Mo. And I'm F-Mo. Greetings, J-Mo. F-Mo, you look ridiculous. Are you damaged? Are you in need of repair? Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Deemo. I busted my core system drivers, and now I need new ones. Fantastic. Okay, please get ready for your total personality wipe. Oh, right, right. Uh, right. I mean, no. I'm just here for, uh, nostalgic purposes. Ah, yes. to the factory for assorted sentimental biz. Please step 100% on the ultratram for your complimentary tour. - Greetings. - Whoa! We're now passing over the famous factory floor, birthplace of each and every Mo. Behold the gleaming machinery, teeming wild with the throes of real creation. From this unlikely chaos emerges every shiny, new Mo. But nothing's moving down there. It's all shut down. What happened to this place? I'm sorry, I'm just a Tram-Mo. I'm not programmed to understand that question. Also, you're just a J-Mo. You're not programmed to ask that question. Uh, what question? That question. I'm serious. Anyway, Mo-Co was founded over 1,000 years ago by Moseph Mastro Giovanni, a sad and gentle man, beloved only by those he built to belove him. On your left, you'll see the core system driver installation port bay Finn! Finn! That's it! That's where the driver ports are! I know. I heard. Hup! What?! Are you crazy? Get back here! Hurry, Finn. I think he's calling the police or something. None of these ports fit right. "E," "D," "C" Where's the "B" port? Intruder spotted! Prepare to vaporize! Vaporize! Cease fire! No intruders spotted. Vaporization complete. Um, but what if they slipped past us, sir, in all that smoke? All right, everyone, about-face. Does anybody see the intruders now? Like I said, vaporization complete. Now, let's head back to base. It's doughnut o'clock. Man, how about those goofs, huh? Trying to mess with our drivers. Yeah, you know the world these days all goofs. Hey, you toss me one of them 'nuts? Ahh. Yeah, hey, speaking of goofs, haven't seen S-Mo 5681 lately. Man, that goof. Yeah, I hate that goof. You ever notice goofs always asking how you're doing? What is that? "Uh, yeah, I'm fine." Yeah, 100%. Oh, hey, what are you doing over there by yourself? Uh oh, uh, uh, I'm sad. Oh, yeah, yanno, we've all been there. So, anyways, how's your goofy wife doing? Pretty goofy. Beemo, how are you doing? Get me close to that guy's port. I can hack into his computer and find where my driver port is. We got to hustle. Yeah, pretty good, I guess. I prefer something yeastier. The wife's always giving me grief about it, but, I mean, what am I, decent? Zomp! Hey, what are you two goofs doing goofing? Dang, man, how deep does this place go? Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down. Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down. Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down. - Psych! - Hey, whoa! Down that grate. Stop right there! You, freeze! Hey! Only Mos are allowed in the facility 1,000%! Get off of my tram! Cram your tram! Womp! Hang in there, Beemo. Hey, Jake, can this thing go any fast Aah! Whoa! Shoot, it's the fuzz! Hit 'em again! Holy! Finn, how are we getting to Beemo's driver port? Uh, turn right! Dog it, they're still behind us! Turn left! Turn corkscrew! Now go down! There's the driver port! Ow. Too spicy. My bod. Non-Mos are forbidden in this facility! I am not Non-Mo. I am Beemo! Beemo. "Beemo"? Did I hear "Beemo"? Wait. What's up? Hey, I'm Moe. Don't worry. My legs don't work. You're Moe? Wait, are you human, too? My skin's human. Dude, how old are you? Hey, come on, now. It is Beemo. Looks like there's some software problems. Hmm. So you made Beemo? Hey, you're not gonna reset our friend's personality, are you? Huh? What? No. Beemo's one-of-a-kind. I built Beemo to take care of my son. Yeah oh, oh, thank you. But I guess I never ended up dating any women. So, that's that. I sent Beemo off into the world alone, hoping He could find a fam A family of his own. And maybe even find somebody else's little boy to take care of. Aww. Oh, there's that back-up driver disk. Thank you. That ought to done it. I must have built, what, like, a million Mos, but Beemo is very, very special. I built Beemo to understand fun and how to play. You see, I made Beemo to be more. Oh, are you my grandpoop? No, I'm just your poop. Wait, did you say you built a million robots? Yeah. All we saw was that tram jerk and all those jerky security jerks. Oh, those were just the surface jerks. Uh, up, please. Yep! Whoops. Oh. Kid, come over here. Beemo, say hello to your family. Hello, family. Hi, Beemo!    - This party is so crazy!


  Wow, everything sucks here. Finn, look! Geez, this looks pretty real. He's got the Enchiridion! And wait Is that Billy? Why's he so tiny? Hey! There's our guy. Whoo-hoo! Yeah, just hang out there for a while! I love it! I feel fresh! Well, this is the weirdest thing I've ever done. _ Round and round and round we go! Hyah! - Yeah! - Yeah! School's out, ya tranch! Whoa! Hey, Prismo's calling. Nice! Let's go say hi. You're lucky I don't take the other one, kid. Quit crying, baby! Prism! Oof! mo otion! Thanks for responding to my call, guys. I'm in a serious pickle, and I mean the bad kind. I mean, like, a really smelly, brown pickle. Don't sweat it, boy. Finn and I got your back. Who's bullying you, Prismo? Nobody's bullying me. Look Um, 'member when you wished the lich never existed and you created a new wish reality that ended up totally not working out? - No. - Vaguely, yes. What? You don't remember making that wish? Whu- I thought I explained it to you that one time. Dude, I'll catch you up. Look. After you wished the lich never existed, you got zapped to an alternative wish reality where magic doesn't really exist. Wait. Who's that dude? That's you, but sort of less cool. Proceed. So you find an old Marceline and the magic crown on the body of Ice King's skeleton who was smooshed under the weight of a frozen mutagenic bomb. But then the destiny gang steals your family donkey, so you use the crown to become Ice Finn and save your donkey and your family. Buuut the crown makes you crazy and you ice everything up like a dumb bozo, which sets off the mutagenic bomb which releases the spirit of the lich anyway. But then this reality's Jake made a counter wish which supposedly fixed the problem, but as it turns out, it didn't really. Can I just say that I don't remember any of this stuff. Because technically it didn't happen to you. But also it still happened and that wish reality continues to exist. Is this why, all of a sudden, one day I was way better at the flute? Yeah, I noticed that. Listen. Something really bad is about to go down. Ice Finn is using his world's Enchiridion to build a portal to the multiverse. We literally do not know what will happen if he succeeds, but it could defs be catastrophic to the architecture of these realities. Now if that happens, my boss Let me repeat that My boss will hold me responsible. And by proxy, y'all both'll be in the dip, too. Finn why not just "bloop-bloop" it all better? Something there is dampening my powers. I am losing my picks over this biz! His boss? Who's that? All right, man, what do we do? Take this and use it to take care of the Ice Finn. Wait. What do you mean by "take care of?" Good luck, guys! We're all depending on you! Whoa. What is it? - Golly! - What's that nay now? It's like 50 bowling balls on my teen bod! Check it. There's instructions. "The maid will handle all class a interdimensional bung-ups if you follow these simple steps. Direct the small end of the maid toward your massive mistake. Focus your intention until all distractions leave your thought sphere, then recite the words 'a man needs a maid' three times." All right. Here We Help-help-help-help-help-help! Lower it. Aagh! Ledge-ledge-ledge. Okay Focus my intention. Just a few more jewels before I can open the portal to a better world! My intention to heal the madness of this other self. Wait, wait, wait. I don't think that's what we're supposed to do. Prismo said "take care of him." Yeah, that means "make him feel better." Are you being stupid on purpose? Yeah, but dude, that is me. That's me. I heard you the first time. There's got to be something else we can do. Bro, you heard Prismo. We don't have a choice. Okay, but you do it. I just can't, man. I-it's too messed up. All right. You're right. Shut your eyes and cover your ears. Ommommommomm A man needs a maid. A man needs A maid. A man Needs A Nope! This is bull juice! Flip! Ommommommomm - Hey, hey. - Did you do it? No, man. - Let's just go steal the Enchiridion. - Whoa, yeah! That way he can't open the portal and nobody gets obliterated. That should work! That's not gonna work, you guys! Don't walk away from the maid. Noooo! It's gonna be so great in the next place, guys! It's like we're spinning Spinning Spinning into the new land! Sneaky fashion. What's this?! Two more converts to my empire of frost? Finn, I love you. Just in case we eat it fighting this guy. Yeah. I love you, too. Wonderful. I thought I'd rescued all the humans! Now you can hang out here with everyone else. Gunter says we just need a few more gems. Anyway, now I'm going to freeze you. Wait! Straight up magic! Are you a wizard, too? Yeah! Check out my amazing wizard bod! Hey, over here, man! Look at me. I'm a portal to another world. You can't be. I'm magic. I can do anything. Don't you believe your own eyes? Why would you be able to turn in Why anything? Why is the sky blue, bro? That's right. Just keep looking at me. Hey, what's up? I'll get you out of this, Billy. It's Bobby. Look out. Who's that? Enter the port What? Big destiny? Jewels. What's wrong with him? He looks possessed or something Ew, boy, here we go. That's my body, dog! My friend, you return! This was all his idea! Come on, that's the lich! He's evil! He's not even trying to hide it, bro! Release. Big D's mind is back. Whoo! I must escape first try! Um What are you doing?! Whoa! Traitor! Jake, let's boogie! You dirty gangsters! We're not a gang! That's you. Pbht! Sleep. Gimme! Bring the book. Okay, buddy. Are we gonna save the world now? Bobby. Open, great book! The final hole is mine To put my thing in. What dimension is this? All of them. That's great. Then we can live everywhere. Everywhere you will die. Heh what? You, your family Everyone Will die. Over and over. Mountains of broken bodies Beneath the wheel. What the? Jake! Whoa! What the Ew. Gross! You used me! Whoa. I trusted you, lich! Mathematical. Freeze! My power. It's gone! Hang on, Finn! Ragh! Yes. The frost! Dude, don't kill him! That's me, kinda. Other Finn, just listen at me. Your name is Finn Mertens! Your best friend is Jake the dog. You have a birthmark like a flaming sideways teardrop In like a really weird place. What? What's going on? Bartram? Yeah, yeah! Your whole thing is you want to help people, remember? We can fix all this. It's like the most evil heartburn! Jake! Get out of the way! A man needs a maid! A man needs a maid! A man needs a maid!  Housekeeping. You're welcome! Ha! I dunno what he's saying. Let's bounce. Prismo, wait. We have so much to talk about. Prismo, I'm sorry if this is breaking the rules, but you got to help this guy out. He's just always gonna be messed up with that crown around. Okay, I can try rearranging some stuff. Just a quick cut And Paste! There! Now the ground zero bomb explosion should destroy the crown in that reality And Play. So, yeah. This all goes down again Bomb goes off, duh-duh-duh So, yeah. The crown is totally gone. Your guy here goes back to normal. That's his family. Hey, look how dumb I am in that world. Here's me Woof-woof-woof! I eat stuff off the ground. I dunno, what are dogs even into these days?


     FlNN: Hey, fart face! Unhand Princess Bubblegum! Foolish interlopers!  Whoa! Ungh! - Hee hee hee! Ooh! My eyesight!  FlNN: Hey, lce King! l bet you'll never kiss the Princess! l wlll kiss her. l will! Hold still.  You just kissed Jake's butt! What?! Ugggggggh!  The hour is yours, but the day shall be mine! Just like you, Princess -- Mine! What a patoot. Thanks for saving the day yet again, boys. You're welcome, Princess. Uh l'm gonna throw you two a party. Meet at the Candy Kingdom tonight! Party! Whoo-hoo! That paper crane for Princess Bubblegum? l just thought l'd bring her a gift in return for throwing us this party. - Heh. l bet you wish you were my butt. What? l bet you wish you were my butt, because then the Princess, you know -- No, wait. l bet you wish you were the lce King and the Princess was my butt. - What?! - Hmmm. Oh! l bet you wish Bubblegum would kiss you, too! Like the lce King and my butt! That's ridiculous!  Ahhh. Huh? Rrr!  What's so funny? Hey, everybody. Finn and Jake are here! Who's ready to party?!  What's everyone laughing at? - Shh! Stand back, everyone. This style of massage is called ''Best Friend Massage.'' Oh, my gosh! Because it can only be done for friends. lt is completely consensual. Oh, holy cow. Relax yourself now, Lumpy Space Princess. Hyah! Oh! l feel so great! Who is that guy? - Ha ha!  Greetings, partygoers. Glad you could all make it. Princess Bubblegum! Princess, l-l just wanted to thank you for -- Oh my gosh! PB, you got to check out this super-cute guy. You're gonna love him. - Uh This is O-oh, my gosh. l don't even know your name. Ricardio. Ricardio at your service. l've been waiting all evening to meet you, Princess.  l've heard you appreciate ancient technology. Have you ever used a balbaflonic laser to align the hybernautilus rift in the boobatron plasmordial formation? Whoa! No, l haven't!  You want to continue this conversation on the dance floor? lt would be my pleasure, Princess. Why didn't the Princess invite me to dance? lf you want to dance, just go dance. FlNN: But now she's dancing with hlm! Oh! l feel weird! Eh, it sounds like you're dealing with some new emotions you don't understand -- Like jealousy. Blaarrrgg! Look, man, just go out there and get down! RlCARDlO: The plasmordial layer is completely independent of the babalons. Dip! - Wow! That would mean that the Babalons would fluctuate with the piranha nanosphere. Correct. - Ugh! They're talking about science, man. l can't compete with that. Do the science dance. Remember it? lt was sort of like this.  Wah-wonh-wenh-anh-enh  You think that'll work? Yeah! Probably. Do it, man! You're a pro! Science dance! Science dance! - proximity to - Science dance! Hey, Princess, you wanna spend some time with me? Excuse me, Princess. You must excuse me. Oh. Uh, all right. Finn! What the cabbage?! l was learning about Zanoits! Oh. l'm into Zanoits. T-They're the best! Zanoits kill hundreds of thousands of plantoids a year. Oh, no! Not the plantoids! Plantoids produce mellotoxin.  Mellotoxin kills Zanoits! So, are Zanoits good things? You're totally jealous of Ricardio. No, l'm not! l just don't like the way he talks to you. lt makes me feel weird. - That's jealousy, hon. l'm not jealous!  l'm weird! Woof! Man, this is going bad! Hey, Finn, you got to come help me slay these peanut monsters at the bar! lt can't wait! Wow, man. What happened out there? Ugh! l-l don't know. l was trying to warn her, but -- but she twisted my words around. Yeah, ladies are twisty, man. Bubblegum's super-smart, too. - l know. And l can't shake this weird feeling about Ricardio. l think he's a villain. Why? ls it because his face is so foldy and dramatic? No! l can just feel it in my gut. He's up to something sinister. Maybe what you feel is romantic rivalry. - l'll prove he's a villain! - How? Stakeout. Here he comes! They're talking. Lemme see. l can read their lips.  ''Hey, shorty, you should pick your boogers and then fart.''  ''You look kind of like a big pink baguette.'' Get serious, Jake! This is life and death! ls it? Don't get me wrong -- l'm all about stakeouts and spying on this guy, but what if he's not a villain? What if he just looks wicked? Some people look wicked but are super-nice. - l gotta trust my gut. - Ooh. He's on the move. Let's roll.  l see him. He's holding rope and going into the trash. FlNN: He's smashing bottles. And pretending to stab someone! So he's recycling? Or what? l think your gut's a little naive, Jake. Holy moly! He's -- he's with the lce King! They're shouting something.  Ricardio is tossing him in the dumpster and running away! So l was right! He ls a good guy -- who's just cursed to look suspicious. You and me, gut. Together forever, solving crimes and making up rhymes. No way! This proves he's a Supervlllaln! More powerful than lesser villains, like the lce King.  Your gut says he's evil My gut says he's good Why not put our guts together And end this funky feud?  Then it's settled. We're gonna confront Ricardio face-to-face and prove he's evil. Or good. Oof! So, what are you doing, Ricardio? Are you evil? - Or nice, with an evil face? That's none of your business. The safety of Princess Bubblegum ls my business. Yeah, we just wanna know if you're evil or not. Oh, yeah? - BOTH: Yeah. Oh, yeah?! Yeah! Yes! You stay away from Princess Bubblegum with all that stuff! Now that my plan is nearly complete, there's no way you can stop me. l could stop you if l wanted! Oh, yeah? - Yeah! Oh, yeah?! Yeah!! Yahh!  What's going on here?! - Princess?! - Ricardio? Yes? l'm all right, Princess. Finn, why'd you do it? He was gonna hurt you with those ropes and bottles! These were for our Balbaflonic laser. lt's not all his fault, Princess. l might have looked a little threatening. Finn, you shouldn't punch brainiacs. You know how fragile they are. You gotta stop this jealous business. - But -- - Come on, Ricardio. l'll patch you up and give you candy.  She hates me now. l was totally wrong about Ricardio. lCE KlNG: No, Finn, you were not wrong. He ls evil!  lce King, what do you know about this? Tell me, or l'll do something! Hold up, Finn. The lce King looks sort of damaged. l don't care. l only care about Ricardio. But my enervated condition has everything to do with hlm. l was trylng to cast a spell that would glve me total control of Prlncess Bubblegum's heart. But l messed lt all up  and lost control of mlne.  He planned to rlp out Prlncess Bubblegum's heart to make lt hls brlde! Blblblblblblblbl!  Wlthout my heart, l grew weak. Ehh! But l made my way to the Candy Klngdom to look for hlm. ln an alleyway, l begged hlm to return to me and leave the Prlncess alone. But then he threw me in the dumpster and left me for dead. Stop Ricardio. - Gah! Come on, Jake! Gotta save the Princess! - Princess Bubblegum! - Princess! Finn! Jake! You were right all along, Finn. Now l'm going to cut out Princess Bubblegum's heart and make out with it. Not if l can help it! Rarrr! Whoa!  One step closer, and l'll remove her heart! Finn, l feel like a big idiot for doubting you. He was just so engaging. But his knowledge on plantoids is actually pretty weak. Shut your mouth up, Princess!  Oof! l'm gonna smooch that heart! lt will be my bride! Why don't you marry someone your own size?! Like my foot! - Huh? Oof! And my fist! - Argh! Ugh! Stop! Stop it! That's my heart, you piece of lce King. Should we let him take his heart back? He is villainous. l don't wanna watch an old man die on Princess Bubblegum's carpet, man. Oh, yeah. - Wait! Wait! Come to Daddy. Yeah, there you go. - N-o-o-o-o-o-o! You like that, huh? See you guys later. l feel wonderful! Ha ha ha! And now that l've saved the Princess, she'll marry me and live in my dungeon every day. - No, she won't! - Yeah, no, l won't! Yes, you will! - Yah! - Oof! Well, maybe not today or tomorrow but another day! Another -- Oyyy! Ugh! Ugh! D'oh! Enhh! Thanks again for saving me -- Agaln. Don't mention it. Now that Ricardio's gone, you don't have to be jealous of anyone anymore. l never get jealous. PRlNCESS: Kiss me, Finn! l mean, ''Kiss me, Finn!'' Am l doing it right, Jake? - And the butterflies and bees We can wander through the forest And do so as we please Come along with me To a cliff under a tree


     Well, looks like your new house is clone.  Jake, you want to check out the new house? Nah, don't let me interrupt you. You two have fun. I wanna see inside. I love it! Great!  Huh. This doesn't hurt as bad as it used to.  Aaaaaaaaaah! Oh, gob! Oh, gob! Oh, gob! Finn!  I'm okay! Hmm.  Oh! Do the thing that I like.  Now do the thing that /like.   Classic. All right, Finn, that's enough.  Thank you for building my new home, Finn. I'm so happy- You want a hug? Yes. Whoa. Hold on, mama.  Okay, bro, tinfoil's on. You can hug now.  Bye. Bye, Finn. Bye. Looks like your date went pretty good, buddy. Ah, I don't know. Was the hug okay? Give me some tips, mang. Bro, you gotta let things take their natural path. Look. Look, let me explain some junk about dating. Right now you're at tier 1, which is hugging. But pretty soon, you'll be at tier 2, which is smooching. Then down the road, you'll make it to tier 5, where she'll let you discover all 15 feet of her long, beautiful stomach. And after a while, you'll make it to tier 8, where you touch her horn for the very first time. Very special. What about tier 15? You stay away from that! Do not do tier 15! Dude, I got no idea what you're talking about. Don't worry about it, dude. Just let things naturally move to tier 2. Oh, and, um you need a shower, dude. What?!  Oh, gross! Do you think Flame Princess could smell me? - Probably. -Crup 'Sup, guys? BOTH: Princess Bubblegum?! What are you doing here? Collecting taxes. You guys weren't home, so I let myself in. - Oh. - I'm gonna take a shower. Princess, do not inhale! - What? Why? - Just don't!  What's that all about? Ah, he's just smelly from a day of running around with his lady friend. Ooh! A lady friend. Do tell. Uh, I shouldn't say. It's his business. Oh, come on. You can tell me. That's his personal biz. You gotta respect a man's p-biz. Okay, you're right. I'll respect it. Flame Princess! He was hanging out with Flame Princess. What?! And I don't mean to be telling stories out of school, but pretty soon, they're gonna be taking it to tier 2. No. This isn't possible. Oh, it's possible. I just never thought Flame Princess. I --  I have to go. BUBBLEGUM: Morrow!  Hmm. Weird. Guess who's late for their video chat?  President Porpoise! No. No. Oh, gob. I thought I'd be ready for this. Yowwwwwwwwn!  Jake, I'm going to see Flame Princess. Be back later.  Finn!  Aaaah! Okay, Princess, you need to stop breaking in here. I have something important to tell you about relationships. Uh, that's okay, Princess. I just hope you'll understand.  Relationships are like layers of sedimentary rock. Jake, Flame Princess is waiting for me. I'm gonna bounce out. Okay. Tier 2, baby. Word.  BUBBLEGUM: If too much frustration builds, the magma will erupt, causing a catastrophic superstratum of igneous rock to form.  What? Where am I? Jake, you're president now. Oh, my gosh!  Jake!  - Wake up! -  - Jake, where's Finn? - He stepped out. Will you tell him why he can't see Flame Princess anymore? Oh. Ohhh! I see what's going on here. Great. I cannot stress how important it is that they not see each other. Oh, man. PB is totally jealous of Flame Princess!  Jump. Punch. Kick. Kick. - 'Sup, man? - Yo, dude. So, what did PB want? She doesn't want you to see Flame Princess anymore. She's crazy jealous. So, you at tier 2 yet? I got about five hugs. Does that count? Nope!  Well, still at tier 1. I know exactly what'll get you to tier 2 -- a sappy poem. Say something about her spectrum. Ew! Let's see she's bright. She's beautiful. She makes me feel confused. Like something's filling up my chest. Like I can't breathe. Is it because she's so dangerous? Glob, Jake, I-l can't stand it! Inspiratio. - Finn! -  Aaaah! Whatcha doin'? Oh. Uh, hi, Princess. I'm, uh, writing something for Jake. Oh. Well, speaking of Jake, did he explain everything to you? Yeah. - And you understand? - Yeah, I understand. Finn, sometimes you want someone and you want to kiss them and be with them, but you can't because responsibility demands sacrifice. What are you trying to say?! I'm trying to say that you're a hero, Finn. You're my hero. So, I'm glad you understand why you can't be with Flame Princess.  Bubblegum, I can't do this anymore! - What? - Now you like me?! Finn, what are you talking about? What am /talking about?!  PB, I was --  I was in love with you, okay?! And you didn't love me back. Now I'm ready to move on, and it's like  you're gonna build me up all over again. Well, I'm done! I'm done. Oh, no.  Bacon pancakes, making bacon pancakes Take some bacon, and I'll put it in a pancake Bacon pancakes, that's what it's gonna make Bacon panca-a-a-a-ke  Finn?! Jake, where's Finn? Is he with Flame Princess? Back off, Bubblegum. That's his man's biz. Is he with her or not?! You heartless monster. Do you have any idea how much he's cried over you?! Finn deserves to be happy! Even if his bloopin' face gets burned off! You should be ashamed! - You're sick! - What are you -- This isn't about some petty love triangle! Flame Princess is physically unstable! Her elemental matrix can't handle extreme romance. Glob, if Finn tries to kiss her, she'll burn so hot, she'll melt right through the planet's crust, down through the molten core. Then she'll be thrown back and forth by gravity until she burns out the world from the inside! Why do you think I had her father keep her locked up?!  Will you take me to them? Faster! FINN: Your wavelengths are my weakness. Your emissions are what I've been missing.  No. Aaah!  Flame Princess?! Flame Princess!  Finn! Finn, there's no time! You have to -- Are you all right? Finn!  Flame Princess!  It's hot! Wait. Wait! Don't move. This is good. If you stay on the hole for 24.8 seconds, the reaction will be deprived of oxygen. She'll go out.  What about Finn? Hey.  What's wrong? Please -- say something.  Please, I need you to be okay.  Huh?   Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm okay. She's stabilized. We're safe for now. Oh, Finn.  What? Jealous? Shut up.    


  Mlwa mlwa mlwalla. Mlwa mlwa, Lord Ogdoad. Master of Level 8 Shadow World. The willing vessel issues forth its pure essence. Ah. Heh heh. Nom nom nom nom. You must overtake the vessel as night must overtake the day. By your very nature, you cannot deny my will! Hello. What jazz is this? Peppermint Butler?! That's the last straw! I will fill you with the shadow of a thousand brown portals! Oh, no, Ogdoad. You are mine. Peanut Butler! Peppermint Butler! Cease these dark magic activities! Hey! Let me go first! I got stuff to do today! What did you do that for?! You neglect your duties to the Princess. She has been in her lab for nine weeks. She needs to get out, socialize. Look her suitors. Her faithful suitors, waiting for a chance to share her burdens. No, man. She won't date those old bags. You must try. The Candy Kingdom worries for its leader, and it worries for you, Dark One. All right, you guys. All you guys are gross. How long have you been waiting to court the Princess? I'm Gerald. Geez! How long have you been here, Crusty? So what? It's not too late, right, boys? It's not too late! Take me on a date! It's my right! Princess all night! Shoosh! What's your deal? I'm Braco, and I was born to court the Princess Bubblegum. How old are you? I inherited my father's place in line after his ascension. Hey! And you want to court the Princess? Yes. My heart instructs me so. All right, buddy. I'm giving you a shot. It won't be easy I was born for this. Love will win on this day. Sounds good, man. Prubs! Hey, what? Pff! Who's that? This is Braco. Son of Logan, who was begat by Hobus. Okay. Yeah? I want to take you on a date. Thank you, Braco. That's very sweet, but no. Princess, this lab reeks like brown mist! It's unhealthy. You've got to get outside and do some research on boys! That is way out of line, Peps, and you guys are donking up my research! Hello! Donk! Donk! Princess, I love you! I-I love you so much it hurts! The pain it Uhh. Hmm. What you're feeling is called infatuation. The pain is a product of you over-valuing a projected, imaginary relationship with me. No, Princess. What I feel is real. Meet me in the garden tonight and unlock the mystery of m-e-e-e-e-e-e! Braco! Come to me tonight! Okay, Braco. But just for research, all right? Yes, Princess! Good job, man! You take it from here! Yo, who's that with PB? That's that Braco guy. Are they on a date? - No, Bro. The Princess don't date. Ah, look! A miracle of nature like you. Now hand it to me. Hmm. Okay, I have what I need for now. Uh-huh. Ca-caw! N-nope. No. No tears for Braco. What did she say? "I have what I need for now." So she will see me again! I shall not falter, Papa! Dear personal diary, in a consequence of my latest romantic misfortune, I decided to consult the man who knew best about her majesty. Father's father. Amongst his most dearest possessions, he kept a book containing every secret of seduction through superficiality. The art of peacocking. Hi, Braco. Nice hat. I know. Right? Heh heh heh. I am peacocking you to rally your attention. Mm-hmm. Um, so, what's that on your head? My crown. Oh. Uhh Hmm. Princess! Dear personal diary I am in terrible pain. Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Uhhhhhhh! She is in her castle somewhere. A lonely heart. Do not fear, Princess. I won't let you down. Princess, Finn and Jake are here, as requested. Hey, guys! Hey, PB. What's up? This is a soul stone. I need one for something I'm working on. Of course, it's really rare, but my scanners found one. It's in the vapor swamps. I printed a map with all the detail. PB, who's the new guy? - What? - Hey, man. Oh. That's Braco a suitor of mine. Oh. Cool. That's cool. You're dating. That's cool. See ya, Princess. What'd you think of that Braco guy? I mean, he seems kind of weird and passive and baby lambish and too unheroic for Peebs. And then I smashed that peach! Jake and Finn, I seek your aid. I need to ask you for that map, therewith I could bring the soul stone to Bubblegum. Then she'll love me! That road you're on leads to nowhere. Oh! Oh! Thank you! Huu-ah! This is as far as I go. Hurry, man! Get off! Oh! Hey, I see you! Oddsbodikins! Uhhh! The soul stone. This journey has come to an end. Ooh! You broke my hands! Ugh! Stop! The beast! The beast! Why have you stolen my treasure, boy? For the one I love. Huh. Take the stone. Hmm. Guess who. Braco? Uhh! What happened to you? Oh, look. Can it be? It's a soul stone! Oh. Y-yeah. Sorry, but I don't need that anymore. I just finished programming a proper simulation of a soul. In fact, this is much easier to manipulate than a real one. Braco? Hmm. Why won't she love me?! Set me free, you tranch! Give me the key to the shadow realm! Uhhh! You said you were going to handle this. You are doing a bad job. All right. I got this. Peace. What's up, man? PB's not into you? Yeah, man. I'm throwing in the towel. Whoa. Come on. PB's a tough nut, but don't drip out. Then you must help me to crack the nut. No problem, man. We'll use magic. Shadow demon magic! Say what? For your freedom, a spell. Yes? Make this man-noodle Braco into a walking love magnet! This I can do. But can you pay the price, Braco? The price is your freedom, man. This price lies outside of our arrangement. To receive, you must pay. Hmm. All right. Well, maybe no dark magic. I'll pay any price for love! Swazaa! Aaahhh! Release! Who's that? What? Raarghh! Am I a walking love magnet? Well, you paid the price, no doubt. And I want to have your babies. To the Princess then! Yo, wait! What about me?! And what's your number-one priority? To find someone special to share my life with. Awesome. You ready to go on some dates? Uh, yeah. Who should I date? There's a guy named Braco who's really nice. Ooh. Where is he? I'm here! Braco?! What happened to you?! I paid the price for love. Was it worth it? Do you love me? Yes, I love you. Then marry me! We'll travel the world, have adventures, make the babes, get fat and weird, and float up to 50th dead world, right? Oh, Braco. I don't want any of that mess. I do love you, but it's the undifferentiated love I feel for all candy citizens. I couldn't permit one of my citizens to suffer the way I saw you suffering over me. And so I made you this. Meet my doppleganger Pbot. Uh, this feels super-wrong. Oh, Braco! Let's get out of this smelly lab. Okay! Thank you, Princess! Whoo! You're welcome, my love. Where is he? Where's Braco?! I let him go, Peps. I knew he couldn't be happy without me, so I built him a robo-wife! You should have given him to me! - This party is so crazy!

Aah! Oh! Ugh!  Ugh! You little twerp! Are you stupid Or something?! Yeah, I'm stupid! But I know something real -- you shouldn't eat your husband! Whoa! Ugh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Aaaaaah! Ohhhhhhhhhhh! Yo. Smoothing things out? Uh, not exactly.  Barb! Barb! What's wrong, my love? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargghh! Aghh! O-kay.  What is happening?! Something we're not supposed to see. Oh, Ed. We're parents! Oh, sick! I think there's hope for us, Barb. We can make a new start -- as a family.  Nice. Think they're gonna make it? Love like theirs will always find a way. It'll crawl all up over you and drain your body fluids, poisoning you slowly until you pass out. Whaaaaaa! Circle of life, Finn. Circle of life. FINN: Yeeeeoooohhhhh!    


Oh, fudge. What time is it? I got to go to Veggie Village for the Annual Technology Fair. Will you all watch my Princess plant for me? I usually hire a sitter, but, eh! Of course, Princess. Awesome. Thank you, Finn. I will be back on the Morrow. Screeeee! You're in good hands, Princess Plant. "And then the monster got punched in the head, and the Princess was safe. And everyone was happy." Aah! Time to lay down, beautiful buddy. Yeah. Time to make sleepies. Ahh. We killed it, man! I know! Okay, all we got to do is go to the land of the dead and reclaim the flower's soul from death before Bubblegum returns. Okay. Excuse me? But did you all say "Land of the dead"? Oh, what? Oh, uh, yeah. I can take you. Really? Certainly, Finn. For a small price, which we can discuss later. Take my hands, gentlemen. Stare into where the two walls meet. Now slowly cross your eyes. Do it, fools! The portal opens. Say hi to Death for me if you see him. He lives in a castle made of light. Uh, okay. Thanks, Peppermint Butler. And don't drink the water. Wow, man. Who knew Peppermint Butler was so 00-- Aah! So, um, you want to hop in my paunch and I'll stretch us down? Uh Oh, look. An escalator. Hey, dude. That must be the main entrance or some biz. Let's go! Wholly schmao. Welcome to the underworld. Cause of death? Uh, spear in the neck. You may enter. Yay! How did you die? Uh Because we're awesome. Whoo! Hmm. Step out of line. Aw, dingle. Wait up, dude. Follow me and do as I do. Hey! I said no! Hey! He-e-y! Ha ha! We're in! Come on, man! Man. - Yes! - Yes! Where do we go now, dude? UP there! Ooh! Death's castle is pretty, dude. Let's go! Hup! Yah! Hey! Hey, what's up, fellas? Hi. Lester. Oh, man -- flesh. I haven't seen this stuff in forever. So warm and gushy and salty. Look at all that flesh jiggling. Hey. If you love flesh so much, then watch this. Whoa! You don't know what you're doing to me, guy. Fellas, get over here! Flesh! Flesh? Yeah. - Ooh, for us? - Whoo-hoo! Yeah. Flesh. This is weird, man. Eh, don't worry. They just think we're cool. Hmm. Do you guys think we're cool? No. We're gonna rip that flesh off you and eat it. It's bone-kicking time! Huah! Huah! Oh, shoot! Ugh! Get -- Ugh, ugh! Jake, there's too many! They're trying to peel me! I'm not a banana!! Hole! It's not a hole, Jake. It's just a divot. Ugh! Sorry! They're getting away. Yeah! Get 'em! Get 'em! Get some bad blood. Dude, shrink down. Oh, sorry. I don't like the underworld too much. I don't know. It wouldn't be so bad if there weren't folks trying to eat our skin. I wonder how Princess Bubblegum is doing. So, who here invented this thing? I'm glad she's not coming back till tomorrow. No, she said she's coming back "On the Morrow." Yeah, on the morrow. That means tomorrow. No, man. The Morrow is her bird. Come again. It's her bird. That thing is crazy fast. It'll only take her, like, that conference is over. Are you listening, man? The Morrow isabird. Then we got to go! Coast is clear! Halt! Hey. Hey, Halt. Why you got your eyes closed, Halt? I'm trying to picture in my mind's eye where the fleshies are hiding. Ohh. You're a smart guy, Halt. Wait. Jake, do you hear something? I don't know where they are. Come on. Then I didn't see them. I was looking here. And now they're gone. More skeletons. We've got to be really, really quiet. Get 'em! Jake. I thought it would be funny! Ugh! Ya-a-h! Look! There's death's castle! I don't see anyone. I guess you double-killed them with that Avalanche. Awesome. Now we just got to cross that river. River! Man, I'm so thirsty. My mouth's still all dusty! Yes. Aah! Drink the water. Whoa. Okay, Jake. Don't drink the water. Come on! I'm so thirsty! Dude, that skull wants you to drink the water. It's bad water. Don't drink the water. See? That means good, right? Yep! Jake? Jake, why are you making stupid face? Who's Jake? Dang it! I knew that water was junk! Tricked again by the river of forgetfulness! Jake! Get out of that water right now! Hey, I don't know who you are, Mister, but I don't like your attitude. Help! Somebody! Farewell, everyone. Tsk. Okay. Morrow, back to the Candy Kingdom. Help! Somebody help me! Stranger danger! Hey. Hey. I see you. Jake, your head. Huh? Who are you? Who are you? I don't know, man. Who are you? What do you mean? You're in my castle! Well, I didn't know. Dang it, Jake. You must leave this place now. Death! We're not leaving until you give us our plant's soul and Jake's memory! Another one. Be gone, mortal! No! I promised Princess Bubblegum. Ya-a-h! Huh? Ugh! Ohh. What happened? You can't kick me because your brain is stupid! Hah! Your brain is stupid! This kid's pretty funny. All right. Pick an instrument. Huh? To get stuff from me, you have to beat me in a musical battle. But Jake's the musical one, and he's got poo brain! I don't care. I got to find one I can really play. Oh, Glob, man. Oh, here we go. Sleigh bells! Yeah-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow! So the contest begins. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!! Ye-e-ah! Uhh, um Hey, all right, so who do you think won? Oh, man! Skeleton guy by a landslide! He was like Dude! What? Skeleton guy was awesome. You want me to lie? Yes. I'm going to kill you now. No! I still have to rescue stuff! Those are the rules in the land of the dead. Lose a music battle, lose your life. Oh, wait, wait, wait! Before I die, I'm honor-bound to tell you Peppermint Butler says hi. What?! You know Peppermint Butler? Yeah. Yo, you guys can have whatever you want. Jake, stand up. That's me, right? Yes. What are you doing? What are you doing?! Kiss of death, baby. You got your memory back. AW, gross! I Wish I didn't. Now I shall return the soul of this. Yeah, the Princess Plant! I'll see you dudes later. Hello, boys. Where's my plant? Hello, Princess. Yay! Mm, mmm-mmm. Thank you, all, for taking such good care of my plant. Now, come here and give me a hug. Yay! Hugs! You guys are the best. Ahem. Mr. Finn? Mr. Jake? I believe you still owe me something in exchange for that favor I did. - Sure. - Yeah. What is it? I'd like your flesh. Quit being silly, Peppermint Butler. I'm going to take it from you while you sleep!


      Dude, how long are we gonna follow this frog? l just want to see him put on that crown. Wow! - Whoa! JAKE: lt looks cool in there. Too bad we don't have the key to this. What are you talking about? l got two keys right here.  Unh! Whoo-hoo! Ugh! Wow. Look at this place.  Jake, are these doughnuts? They look like doughnuts. But maybe they're polsonous doughnuts! -  - Yeah, sniff it, Jake! Suck up those toxins! Wait a second. l don't know what poison smells like. WlTCH: Hey!  Razzamafoo! - Hey! - What gives? You ate one of my doughnuts! No, l didn't. l just sniffed it.  You're lying! The stink of magic dog lips is everywhere! Holy slug, lady. Calm down. Listen, Mrs. Witch -- l never married. Well, l never ate your doughnuts. You -- you're eating one right now! l am not. Whoa! Huh. That's weird. l don't even remember grabbing this. My subconscious must be hungry, huh? Eh, whatever.  Magicus no moricus! - Uh-oh. - Aah! -  - Dude, are you okay? Yeah, l think so. Just a little chilly. Whoa!  What did she do to you? l stripped him of his magical powers. For stealing one of your billions of doughnuts? Yeah, it's not like l killed your husband or something. l am not married! The point is, you overreacted. And what gives? l used to have like eight more of these things. The only way l'll give back your powers is if you admit your error and say you're sorry -- and mean it! 'Cause l can tell the difference. Well, you can forget it, because you're the one who's wrong! Right? - Total support, dude.  Go backicus from whence you camicus! Aw, now, you're just making these up! Are you all right, my -- my doughnut pretties?  Wait a second. You're a bagel! Liar! Liars everywhere! There's got to be a way to get your powers back! Where'd they come from, anyway? Were you born with them? Or did you have a freak industrial accident?! Heh, that takes me back. Let me just  remember!  l see a memory. When l was just a pupster l'm rolling around in a mud puddle. And l'm just lovin's it.  Oh, no! Ugh!  Whew! Remembering is hard work. What happened next? Oh, um, um, l went into the mud, and l guess l became a magic dog? Okay, then our course is clear. We'll roll you in every mud puddle in Ooo until we find the one that'll restore your powers! That's nuts, man. You got any idea of how many mud puddles are in the land of Ooo? Four? Maybe even five? Jake, come on! We've always been lucky, buddy. Maybe the first mud puddle we find will be the right one. Nonsense. But l like it! Then away! Yeah, let's do it! - Ugh! - Oh, my gosh! Ugh. l forgot that l don't have magic powers anymore. How do we search for the mud without my powers? We run -- run like energetic little boys!  This whole time, l thought running was some sort of leg magic.  Look at me. l'm running!  Oh, no.  Grr! Running is evil. Come on, lazybones. lt's too hard. l guess you could ride on my backpack.  l can't reach.  You good, Finn? You're strangling me a little, is all.  Look, there! Across the river of junk, there's an ideal mud puddle! l'll stretch into a boat!  Starting to really miss that old magic of mine. We can swim this river easy. Hup! Come on, Jake!  Man, that looks exhausting. You're right, Jake, it ls exhausting.  What are you? l'm your subconscious! Okay. What are you doing here? l'm here to tell you that what you're feeling deep down inside is true. lt ls way too hard to swim across the river. lt's easier to wear a hat. Here, have a hat. Heh, heh! BOTH: Yeah!  Man, l'm glad l met you. Jake, stop talking to yourself! Cross over, already! Uh, l can't swim that river, dude. My subconscious says it's too hard. Check out this hat, though. Grrr! What's wrong with that guy? Then just wait for me there!  Stupid What you working on, Finn?  Doing everything! Look at you, doing stuff. Oh, is it a chair -- a chair for my butt? Whoa! Ugh! Mudventure! Did it work? Oh, yeah, l can feel this working. ln fact, you should roll in the mud with me, Finn! We can both be magic! Yeah!  This isn't working at all. This isn't the right mud. l was just really hoping this was over and done.  Okay. Then let's just go find another mud puddle. Actually, feeling kind of chubby-tired. Can't we do this tomorrow? Ugh! This is stupid! Just go back to the witch and apologize and get your powers back. Never! l'd rather be powerless forever than apologize! l'm lazy but prideful. You're not even trying, man! First you won't run, a-and now you keep -- and -- a-and no matter what l just -- you just -- you Adventuring is too much hard work for a bro without his powers. But you are an adventurer. Nah. From now on, l'm just your regular old dog. lronic, given my current man-baby body.  Behold, the beautiful mermaid of the river! Ugh! Which one of you mortals wants to mate with all this?  Oh, um how do l say, ''you're the grossest thing ever,'' without offending you? Grrrr! l'll scare her off, Finn.  How do we beat power like that? - Finn, l've got an idea. - What is it, buddy? Rub my belly! Yeah, l'm one of those kind of dogs. Grr! Yah! Finn? Finn! Come on, Finn! You got to save yourself! l'm just a dog! Aw, man. Oh, geez. Okay, then l'm back on the team!  l'll save you! Jake? Don't worry! Hey, Finn, can you help me to get up there? ALL: Hungry, hungry, hungry. Ohh. lf only l had my powers back! The only way l'll give back your powers is -- l know, l know! l have to apologize to that witch. Oh, you're doing so well.  And l hate you so much. Hey! Witch! l need my powers back! So l'm sorry! l'm so sorry l ate your doughnut! Razzamafoo. Huh? Uh, oh. So, do l get my powers back?  Mmm. Apology denied. What? Why?! Because you took too long. Now you have to apologize while doing a variety of humiliating things. No way, Jose! Come on, dude. lt's the only way to save Finn. - Who is that?! - He's my subconscious. Then he has to do it, too. Aw. l Jake the dog while slow-dancing with my subconscious With flowers in my underwear do humbly apologize. Wait, wait. Start over. - You're recording this? - lt's for my newsletter. No way. l have my dignity. Then guess what, cool guy -- you can forget about getting your powers back -- ever! Oh, no, dude, what do we do now?  Oh! l'm dying, Jake. - What? - He says he's dying. Let that be a lesson to all you cupcakes. Why are you dying, bro? Because l'm the subconscious of your old magical self.  Goodbye, Jake. No! No!  So, l've finally broken you. Yeah!  lf only l were a humbler guy, my subconscious would be alive, and my best bud wouldn't be trapped in a mermaid's nest! Yes! Gloat, gloat, gloat! All right, l think you've learned your lesson. l forgive you. My powers! How can l ever thank -- Ha! Got your cane! Aah! Ugh! But didn't you learn your lesson?! Nope!  ALL: Hungry, hungry! Aah! Remember to save the brain for dessert! JAKE: Honey, l'm back! How about a big kiss?  Aah! You guys are so cute, l could just maul you to death.  - Jake! l never should have doubted you. Well, l'm glad you learned your lesson -- that in a crunch, there's nothing l wouldn't do for you. Ahh! So, is that how you got your powers back? You apologized to the witch? Um, no way! l, um -- l must have found the right mud puddle. Yeah, l-l don't remember. Heh.  


    BOTH: Ooh. Ahh. Oh, oh, man. My throwing-and-catching disc. Jake, want to play throw-and-catch the throwing-and-catching disc?  Yeah, man. BOTH: Throw and catch! Throw and catch! I call dog, and you be human. All right. Yeah. Whoo! It's gonna be awesome! Dog! Dog! Dog! Dog! Dog! You mean "Bark." What? Oh, yeah. Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark!  Hello, I'm a human. Ready, bark! Back up a little. And now for the perfect throw.  Ah! Oh! My hammies. Perfect throw! More like the perfect "blow." That blew. Oh, come on. That was the wind. The wind blows. Hey, you want me to grab it? No, I'll get it. Okay, but it's right here. Sometimes a man just has to retrieve his own disc. Good luck, buddy. Thanks. Hup! Pbht! Oh, well, hello there, my friend. What are you doing? I'm trying to get to the top of this tree to get my disc. Oh, well, maybe I can help. Sit on me. Uh, what? Well, sit on my needles. The shock will boost you high up into the air.  Sit on me. It's fine. Go ahead. I don't think that kind of thing really works, actually. You can do it if you believe in yourself. Sit on me. No. Oh, all right. I'll show you.  Ouch! Sorry. I thought that would work.  I'm just no help at all. Ooch. Hmm. See, you did help.  Pooped.  Pooped. - Oh, I apologize for staring. - Hmm? But I've never seen a chipmunk as big as you.  I'm not a chipmunk. I'm a human boy. I'm trying to climb the tree. I'm trying to get my disc back, but for now, I'm taking a break, 'cause I am pooped. You should eat an apple to re-invigorate your climbing ability. No thanks. I'm good. Just gonna rest my meathooks. Huh? Huh?  Ohh, that apple was cursed or something. I'm sorry. I didn't know. Oh, dear. I ruined your day, and now you'll never get your disc. No, it's okay. I've been in worse situations. And even though I'm tiny, I do feel invigorated. Oh, good. What a relief. Best of luck to you. Bye-bye. Choo-choo! You can't stop this train, tree. Hyah!  Whoa, you're tiny. I ate a magic apple by mistake. Oh, no wonder it's been taking so long. You need any help? Nah, I got it. Okay, well, I'm gonna walk Lady home. I'll be back later. Don't eat any more magic apples, silly. Yeah, no, I won't. I don't plan to.  Thank you for packing.  You should take it easy.  No, no, let's get you back. Bleh. Disc!  Whoo! Where's my dingus?  Hey! Hey, buddy! Hey, have you seen my disc?!  Wrap it up good so I don't trip and fall on my face like the last time. Hey! Must have could not heard me. Doink. Doink. Doink. Hey. Squirrel!  VOICE: I think we all agree the human must be stopped. Whoa. - Squirrel, what happened with the apple'? - Well, I made sure he ate that apple like you guys told me to do, but get this. It made him smaller. I think it might have been cursed, you guys. Well, of course, it was cursed. We're trying to stop the human.  Look, just do me a kindness and go get me some more nutmilk. Come on, fellas. I feel like I'm the only one coming up with ideas here. Lenny, how do you think we should stop the human? Ummaybe a trap door? Something like that? With gravity? OWL: Hey, yeah. We could put, like, a rug over it.  My disc! ALL: Aah! Urn, it's okay. I'm a chipmunk. ALL: In the tree, part of the tree. In the tree, part of the tree.  Sorry.  ALL: In the tree, part of the tree. In the tree, part of the tree. Hyah!  Huh? What? Uh, I didn't say anything. What are they gonna do to me? What? What are they gonna do -- I'm not allowed to talk to you. Anyone or anything that winds up in the tree becomes part of the tree forever and ever. In the tree, part of the tree. So does that mean I'm a prisoner forever? Well, yes and no. Are you a prisoner? Yes. Will you ever be free? No. In the tree, part of the tree -- it's very simple. Doesn't that mean you can't leave the tree, either? No, I -- well, yes and no. Am I allowed to leave the tree? No. Have I already left the tree? Am I miles away from the tree right now flying around like the flying squirrel that I am? Yes. In my mind. Do you like it here? Yeah -- well, yes and no. Do I like the nuts and acorns? Yes. Do I like it when they put me down and say mean things like, "You're not a flying squirrel. You're just a regular squirrel. Nyah!" No. Do I want to fly away from this place now? Yes. Would I make a break for it if I had a buddy to break out of here with'? Yes. Hey, buddy. What? Let's get out of here. I got it! What are you doing, regular, non-flying squirrel? Put that back. Pbht!  How dare you!  Well, all right. Everybody, after those two.  Okay, I'm gonna throw the disc alongside the branch. Then we'll jump on it and fly away. Yeah! Perfect throw!  So, it's a good thing you're a flying squirrel, huh? Well, yes and no. ALL: In the tree, part of the tree. In the tree, part of the tree. In the tree, part of the tree. In the tree, part of the tree. In the tree. Peace out! Okay, activate your squirrel flaps. Flaps? No, I just have regular squirrel arms. BOTH: Hey. We're flying! Ohh! Oh, yeah.  Whoo!  Hey, look. There's Jake. Jake!  The perfect throw.    This party is so crazy!


  Oh, man! All right. What's next? Let's see. First, we visit Tree Trunks for apple pie, and then we go to Bubblegum's science music thing. Wait -- what about the movie at the drive-in? That's after we make dream sandwiches. Whoo! Let's go! Apple pie! Whoo! Tree Trunks! Huh? - T.T.! - Tree Trunks! Oh, my, look who's here. Yoo-hoo! Whoa! Oh. yeah! Howdy, Jake. Howdy, Finn. Hello. What are you doing here? I never really left. Mr. Pig's been so kind, helping me tend to my rose garden. Hmm. Cool. Cool, cool. Cool, cool, cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Oh, you. Where's the apple pie, Tree Trunks? Yeah, my stomach is jonesin' for it bad. Oh, you all are so early that I haven't even started. Ahh, ha. I love her so much. Whoa! You love her? What? No! You just said you love her. You're crazy. Dude, come on. We heard you. I think I am in love with her! But I don't know how to go about it. Dude, you should just tell her how you feel. Whew. What are you boys chatting about? Hmm? Uh-huh. All right. Okay. Miss Tree Trunks, ma'am, today I wish to speak my feelings. Mr. Pig, what's going on? When I see you, my heart beats like a choo-choo train. When you stand near me, I get so nervous, I cannot move Ohhh. Mm, that's good. Shush. I feel the same. I have a feeling that this feeling is what others call "love." What should we do, then? We should hug. Tree Trunks, you gonna bring some apple pie to Princess Bubblegum's thing? Uh, yeah, Jake, yeah. Well, okay. See ya later, then. Mmm. Bonk, beep, woomp, wowoow, bing-bong, shoo, da-be-dop-dop, ooh. Where is she? You givin' me a back rub, Bro? What? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hmmmmmraa! Is that It's Tree Trunks! Pie! Pie! Lay it right here! Oh, Jake, I tried to bake an apple pie, but this cutie kept distracting me. No apple pie?! This is making me uncomfortable. They are snuggling too long. What is happening? I forgot my glasses. Huh? Oh, gross. Hyah! Break it up! Break it up! Okay, the love show is over. Princess, please continue. Hmm. This is too much! Aaaaah! Aaaah! It's driving me crazy! Cinnamon Bun, do something! Okay. Hey, everyone! The concert is over! That's not what I -- The concert's over, Princess! Princess, how's about a slow song so me and my man can dance cheek-to-cheek? Humph! Humph! Err! Why is everybody givin' me the hairy eyeball? Y'all are too affectionate. It makes people feel bothered when you and the pig flaunt your affection in public. They don't want us to flaunt what we have? You two need to hide your love, Or else you'll end up making the whole world throw up. We promise to keep our affection hidden. Thank you. Have you seen my other shoe? I think I saw it in the closet. Aah! Under my shoe?! Outta here! This carriage is for babies! For babies! Nice stacks of sandwiches. You shouldn't have bought so many flavors. I had to make a sandwich for each flavor and for each flavor combination. I'm making a cheese sandwich. Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch! Mwah! Ugh. Tree Trunks! Pig! Come on! We're trying to hide our love, but it's so difficult. Try harder! Doesn't look like Tree Trunks and Pig are around. Yeah, looks like the coast is clear. Look at this cup! Now look at this cup! Look at this one! Oh, man! Just try to ignore it and watch the movie. I can't ignore that! Stop! Tree Trunks, this has gone on long enough. No more spending time with the Pig unless you do it inside your own home. But, Finn, an unmarried couple living together under one roof -- that's indecent! Then why don't you two just get married? We don't want to rush things. - Marriage is a big step. - We need time to get to know each other. Then I guess we only have one option. All right. You can't do this. Wait. No! Stop! Take them away! Sweet meat! Little dove! Sorry, Tree Trunks. So, where do you live? I'm homeless. Oh. I guess I'll just go back to eating criminals. Ugh! Guh! I miss her! I don't know what I'm gonna do without him, Finn. Why don't you make apple pie to take your mind off of it?  Dream of love ls it really over? Can I overcome these tears? I close my eyes Feel that he's still with me Still standing with me here Dream of love Are we truly parted? Must this pig forever walk alone? In my dreams, our love is just a dream to me But in my heart, it lives and breathes and grows And even though we ain't allowed to be together I cross my heart and promise to be true Well, I'm still loving you, girl From halfway 'cross this great big world! And in my dreams, I'm holdin' hands with yo-o-o-o-o-o-u Dream of love Dream of love It's only a dream of love Jâ  Dream of love Dream of lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ve It's only a dream Of love I close my eyes and feel his arms around me In my dreams, he's not so far away  Go to him. Go. I'm freaking out! You know what? I like it. It's nice. Yeah. Mmm. Apple pie, I've been waitin' to kiss you all day. Mwah!    This party is so crazy!


The Lich Dark times are coming. You talk like justice, Billy, but you can't kick a plane. Are you alright buddy? Another nightmare? Yeah, that dang snail again, man, monkeying it up again. But, there were other guys this time too. The bear was there, and some dogs, and Billy's lady, and Billy. And Billy was really scared of something fierce, man. Something real fierce. And the cosmic owl was there too, kind of, screeching it up. Whoa, the cosmic owl? What if that was a premonition dream, Finn? Do you think? Could be. We better go tell Billy about it, just in case. He'll know what to do. Dang. Whoa. I dreamt I was in kindergarten again, but I had really big feet, and was also the teacher. Come on. We better hurry. Hello? Billy? Billy, wake up! What the heck are you guys doing in my crack? It's three o'clock in the morning! Oh, you know, just dropped by to say hello. See what you've been uh up to, what uh How are these days? We came to see if you're dead. What? Why would I be dead? Yeah, stupid I had a dream about a bear, and an old lady, and a snail, and you were there, and the snail killed you or something. Was the cosmic owl there? Yeah, on tv. Does that count? Your dreams are omen of grave significance. - Finn? - Yeah? Are you ready to come with me on a mission to save all life from The Lich? Yes. Wait. So, we have to snatch the gems out of all the crowns of power? - That's right. - Cool. Why do we have to snatch 'em? Can't we just ask 'em for 'em? No time. The faith of the world hangs in the balance. Oh, yeah. I forgot. "I suck hamburgers" - Are you sure that's a gem? - I think so. It's so deep. Gross. Man, we got so many gems. This is crazy. Hey, Billy, how many gems we still need to get? Two? One? Wait, two or one? I want candy. You got anything in the saddle bag? Get out of there! The Enchiridion? How did you get this? I found it in the mouth of a bear. A bear? This book is really important. It has magical powers. Turn the little sword sideways. Cool! What is this stuff? Hold on. Hello, my name is Booko. What you see here is the map of the multiverse. It shows all the known dimensions and the links between each of them. This is the dimension that contains the universe in which we currently reside. Enhance! Make it stop! Anyway, at the center of the multiverse there's a dimension called the time room, believed to be the quasi-corporeal dwelling place of the almighty Prismo. The time room is a single dimension that exists outside of time. The time room produces the time waves that are experienced by the dimensions. Some dimensions have permanent links that allow travel to and fro, others become linked temporarily by naturally forming wormholes, and others can become linked artificially by magical portals torn open by items of great power. Once the last gem is inserted into the Enchiridion it will have the power to create a portal to any dimension in the multiverse. An activated portal creates a time dilation in which either end of the portal experiences a temporal synchronization allowing for the safe passing of particles through a non local region of space-time. I'm gonna push the Lich in there. Oh, cool! Let's go get that gem! Yeah! Hi! Who's there? Princess! Princess! I need the gem from your crown. What the junk? No! Get off! Get off of me! That was an accident. Finn , stop! Hurry! Finn, stop! That's not Billy! It's the Lich! Lich alert! Lich alert! Billy! Billy? The book, Finn. Give me the book. Quickly, child, we're running out of time! Lich! You you messed Billy up! You just wanna mess me all up. Mess everyone up. You tricked me! No, child, it's all true. The book has great power. I can make you live forever. Anything you want. Just give me that book! No, no, no! No more tricks! You'll never get this book! No! Oh, no! Finn! What did you do? What? Thanks, Finn. I couldn't have done it without you. Jake, stop him! Don't let him through that portal! Hang on, Jake! What now, princess? Hold on, Jake! Finn! Finn, would you come in here please? Hurry! It's very important! Coming, mom! Man, she sounds steamed. Guess I done dung something up yet again. Come on, Jake.

Uh I definitely knew that.  (WHISPERING) I'm gonna murder Shelby.  Well, hey, you guys should stick around.

(SOBBING)  Hugs! Hugs!  The hugs helped my crying,  but it didn't help me find my rolling pin.  Boy and Dog will find your rolling pin.  Where did you last see it?  It was rolling around here not too long ago.  (GASPS) Oh, there it goes.  Come back, you bad little rolling pin!  (RUSTLING)  Bush Boots, let's sneak up on it.  (RUSTLING)  (GASPS)  Am-boosh!

The pond has a face and is talking to us.  Yeah.  Dive in. (SWIRLING)  I don't feel comfortable diving into a face.  Dog, let's go back for apricot pie.  Yeah, pie!  (THWAP!) (GRUNTS)  (THWAP!) Gross!  Whooooa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  (SPLASH!)  JAKE: And there was, like, a PB puddle, a Marceline plant,  and a little bee that looked like you, BMO!  You know what? We didn't save the Sea Lard.  The Sea Lard saved us.  Yay, Sea Lard!  Wow. What an adventure.  And there was even a purple lady kind of like you, Ice King.  She even sounded just like you.  She sounds magnificent! How'd you say you got there?  We didn't. Beat it, creep.  I'll figure it out.  But, Simon, if you go there, you'll lose your memories.  What memories? I'm like a goldfish over here.  In what way, exactly?  - Hmm? - Oh, hey, Jake.  Where am I?  Comfy, dude?  I bet you ran away 'cause we didn't appreciate you  and called you gross and stuff.  But you're not gross.  (SMOOCHES)  Good night, Sea Lard.


Woo! Woo! Woo! Sick! Sick! So si-i-i-ck! Dying! Check it out. I got snacks for while we wait. For Marcy red lick-rish. Thanks. And for BMO Fresh boyz! So, Finn What are we waiting here for? What?

Today's the day when squeeze-e-mart always gets their monthly shipment. What? That's really weird, guys. - Why would - Stop talking! Here it comes! Enjoy super porp. I love you, Cheryl. Man, this biz takes me back. I used to drink this stuff all the time when I was a kid. What? That's not right. How could the exact same soda still be in production hundreds of years after the great mushroom wars? Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh! Okay, listen. So, okay, we could go track down the mysterious source of super porp. Do up a f'real quest, end up fightin' some big soda-computer-god-baby or whatever We totally could. But super porp is good. So why question this good thing, man? Why? Hmm yeah, okay. Let's just go home. Yay! Super porp! Yay! BMO! Enjoy super porp! We will, Cheryl! No, Cheryl. Susan will not enjoy! Chill out, Susan strong.

Susan killed Cheryl! No! This is fake style bubblehead. Cheryl trying to trick us! Baby! That hole too small for Susan. If Sally say so Hup! Hyah! You two, follow baby cries. Susan will find other way. Hmm? Uh Hey! No one is allowed to taste pure porp syrup! You know this, Carla. But it looks sooo good. Well, of course it does! I mean, I'd smash everyone's face in this room for a single drop of pure porp. But that's not the super porp way. Aw, cheer up, girl. Maybe we'll get bonus reg-porp after that new baby gets processed. Baby! Hey! Where's your hairnet?! Ow! Where's your hairnet? W-w-where's your hairnet? Where's your Okay, verbal warning this time. Protect the pure porp! Uh-oh. Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Now you tell Susan where you take baby or I'm Hey, are you new here? Are you new here? Attention.

Selected by my loyal delivery drones to take my place as high mascot Cheryl. - For you see - Uhhh! Don't drink that. Good job, bozo. Without a new Cheryl, brand awareness will go straight down the toilet. Our in-your-face flavor will be lost forever. Who are you to condemn our weird ancient ways? Stop! Cheryl? Yes, I am Cheryl. And Cheryl says this is what we do now. Back to work! Everybody, destroy the factory! Destroy the factory. Back to work. Destroy the factory. Back to work. All right. Well, it's one month later. Aw, yeah! Here it comes! Enjoy super porp! Ugh! I jinxed it!


-  -  -  -  -  -  Aw. Don't worry about him. It's good to be passionate about your hobbies.  Yo, TV! - Get me a chocolate bar! - Okay. Attaboy! - Ah! - Hello, young man! - Oh! - Sike. Delicious chocolate bridge  Ugh! Yeech! Huh? "This diary belongs to B.P. Private property. If you're still reading this, you're a bad person." Uh Statue of limitations. Dear diary. Wow. I sound like a real cornball. Oh, well. Dear diary! Mom is going to love you. She's always ragging about me spending too much time with my nose in books. I wonder what I'm going to write in you. What kind of person will I be when I get to your last page? Will I have my braces off? Will I have written a song that doesn't totally suck? Will I have met a cool guy? I can barely look at dudes without breaking out into hives. Just another day in teenage purgatory. A.K.A. The school caf. Sloppy Joes again. Boys I did not talk to today brownieguy Are they trying to kill us? Stayed in and tried to cut my bangs. Mom says it looks like I got in a fight with a snapping turtle. Taffi and Mochi are the coolest girls at school. When I think about them, my skin feels sparkly. They don't even know I exist. Why would they? I'm a nobody. Less than nobody. - I'm a pimple on the butt of a - Geez, B.P. - Prone to dramatics much? - The fire kingdom has officially frozen over. Justin rockcandy asked me to - the semi-formal! - Oh, my glob.  Justin. Justin is taking me to the fructose fair. Justin wants to go on the roller coaster. Kissing is fun and easy. If I don't think about the bacteria in spit teeming, multiplying. Diary, can you keep a secret? Justin! Justin! Hive of bees in myea get out! Mother, I'm not going to tell you again! Lies, lies, lies! Diary, it's my birthday tomorrow, but I don't feel like celebrating. I feel like screaming. Justin wants to meet at lovetree point. Says he wants to give me a present. I should tell him I need to tell him - I will tell him! -  Tell him what?! Aaaaaah!  Not hungs. Heading out for a bit.  There you go! Just needed a lil' push from the old man.  I gotta get into the mind of this kid. Role-play. Rip! Rip! Sploosh! My secret is safe at the bottom of this disgusting moat.  Oh, oh, B.P.! What have you done?!  I'm sick of the lies! Sick, sick, sick!  Babe! Um I said I'm sorry?  You don't know me! Nobody knows me! Leave me alone!  I hate sloppy joes! Aaaaaah! Yuch. What? Taffi? - Mochi! - Hey, moch'. Is that the new "nosy nellies" bootleg 7-inch? - Taffi, Mochi, down here! - I ordered it from this dude - in lumpy space. - Is it insane? - It's almost too insane. - Wicked. - Hiya, B.P.! What's up? - Justin? Guilty as charged. You psyched for your birthday, birthday girl? Don't forget about our little "rendez-vous" at lovetree point, huh? I can't wait for you to see your prezzie. You're gonna be there, right? Please say yes. Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Aaaaaah! Bam! Bam! Bam! Lady, you're really off your game! I never win at canasta!  You said you wanted the kid to spend more time outside. Bam he's outside. - He's loving it! -  If it'll make you feel better, then yes. But I'm sure he's fine. Uh-oh. -  - Uh, son? - Mom? - Uh, close enough. - Get out of my room! - TV, what is that? - Private property. - Gimme the book. - Nooooo! - A diary, huh? Juicy. And now you've become dangerously obsessed with it and have confused your reality with that of the diary keeper. You always were a little too susceptible to fantasy. - Ooh, ripped pages! Mystery! - And look how the handwriting changes right before the rip. These are all crabbed. - That's weird, right? - Super weird, son. She was obviously emotionally distraught. Maybe she was so stressed, she broke out in hives, and they covered her whole body. So they rushed her to the hospital. She was thinking "oh, man, I'm so young," and how life is so unfair, and that this was the end.  But it wasn't the end. She had pulled through Except her hand had been replaced with a crab hand! Which negatively affected her handwriting. Yeah! And, and, while I recovered, I - refused all visitors. - Wait. You refused? Especially Justin. How could he love a girl with a crab hand? I mean That is definitely not normal. Justin sent me flowers every day for a week. Then every other day. Then they stopped coming all together. On my birthday, I decided I was going to keep my promise to meet Justin, crab hand or no crab hand. But when I got to lovetree point, Justin was already there  Making out with my BFFs Taffi and Mochi! He did not! Well, that's one theory, anyway. - Am I unlovable? - Hey, did you say lovetree point? That's where the kids used to go smoochin' back in the day. This diary must be pretty old. -  - We should go check it Ugh. This place is a dump. Why do they call this lovetree point? 'Cause of that tree over there. - Yeah, it's pretty heavy-handed. - On page 42, it says Justin hid a present somewhere around here. - Maybe it's in the tree. - Hey, good thinking. - Bingo! - It's so beautiful. Yeah. B.P. Would have loved this. Justin must have been too devastated to reclaim it. Maybe he thinks she'll come back for it one day.  We've got to find her, dad!  She never knew how much she meant to him. To all of us! -  -  Y'know, son, I bet i know where this music box is from. Maybe they can give us a clue. Oh, yes, yes, this is one of mine, from my "dancing cat" period. Do you remember who bought it? Oh, goodness, it feels like a lifetime ago. I must have made hundreds of boxes since then, each marrying sound and motion to tell a unique story, the dance of the cosmos in miniature. Okay. Well, we gotta go. - A young man bought this! - Justin! - Was he handsome? - Oh, very. - Who was it meant for? - A girl. Betsy. -  B.P.! - She ran away. Went wild, cut herself off from the world, hid away in a cave, - never to be seen again. - Whoa! But, dad, there are probably hundreds of caves in it's the one at the fork in the road to butterscotch lake! The box said she does weird stuff to bodies up there. - That's it! -  Why do you think Betsy ran away, dad? Hard to say. Some people can't face their troubles. But, TV, hiding away won't solve anything. - Look! - Teachable moment. Betsy? Betsy? Aaaaah! Betsy. Oh, my glob. We're too late! She was too good this cruel world. - It's a model. - Huh? It's plastic. "Heeyyy." Hey, look at this! A letter. - Maybe we shouldn't read this. - Yes, we should. Dear Justin, I'm not sure you'll ever read this letter. Maybe I'm writing this more for myself anyway. You know when you're little and the future feels really far away? You don't know what it looks like. You just hope you'll have stuff figured out by then. You'll know exactly how to act and feel. You'll have conquered all your fears. And you'll never feel dumb or uncomfortable. You don't think about how you'll actually get there. The middle parts, between now and then The middle parts suck! Which is why I split, I guess Okay, so riding out your teen years in a cave is pretty dramatic. But do you know how much reading you get done in a cave? I even figured out a cure for my crab hand! Oh, Justin, I hope you're not too upset, and I hope you didn't spend too much money on that birthday present. It wouldn't have worked out between us anyway. You're kind of clingy. Sincerely, nurse Betsy poundcake. Nurse poundcake! - I've got the injection, doctor. - I'm not gonna make it, man! Gah! You will live. Way to take control of the situation, nurse. Save it for the post-op, doc. Wow. B.P. is nurse poundcake. - She turned out fine. - But what about the ripped pages? Oh, I saw them in the cabin. It was just a lot of mean stuff about Justin. Hey, that guy must be pretty sad, huh? Hey, you wanna go find him? No.


     Jake? Jake?  - Hey, man. - Hey, dude. You still thinking about Yeah. Yeah? Me, too. Princess Bubblegum's ready for us, so we should go. - Okay. Just give me a few more months in here and I'll be ready. It's okay, man. Just just play it off. Just make a-a normal face. See? Normal face. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming. We may begin the ceremony!  Thanks for bringing us along on the trip, Peebs. Yeah. It's unfortunate we can't enjoy some of these cool things we're passing by, but I guess we could do that the next time we're in the Desert of Wonders, whenever that is! We're on a mission to collect samples only. I want to start colonizing this area by the end of the year. You are killing me, PB! James, give a readout on fuel. Right away, Princess.  Boop! Boop! Boop! Boop! Beet! We have a surplus of fuel, so after we collect samples, we may explore. BOTH: Yeah! I'm glad James is on this trip. Hey, James, thumbs up, buddy! Dude, James is kind of, uh, goofy. I wasn't gonna say anything, but yeah. Maybe when we get to know him better, it'll be charming. James, slow down. We're here. JAMES: I'm registering mondo mega rads down there. I'll ready the radiation suits upon landing. Excellent. Take us down. Hold on to your sack lunch! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Okay. You guys collect as many surface samples as you can rocks, plants, dirt, anything. Mostly looks like it's just dirt here. This will be fun. Jake, open up the basket. I'm gonna make a shot! Do it! Chk-chk! Whoop! Ha ha!  Wah-wah! Hmm.  Aah! Ach! Brownstadt! Guys, run! James, speed up that sack lunch! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!  Ugh!  ALL: Whoa! Ugh!  Ugh! Everyone okay?  Huh? FINN: Oh, my garf! What are they?!  Uh, they're toxic creatures from another time. Okay, let's see suspension's all donked, navigation's lost, and the ship's legs are kaput. We're dead in the water. Chk! Ah-oogah! Oh, yuck! Come on! Manners!  Gotta brain out the situation.  Those goo monsters will barf their way through the hull in mere minutes. Finn, what should we do? Uh let's radio for help. Good idea, but looks like the radio's kaplowed. Pbbt! I can fix that radio. Mrow-row-row! Pling! With this! It's a lucky coin! Bam! When I bust out my coin, great stuff happens, like when I was chosen to go on this mission with you guys! Hee hee hee hee hee! Mnh. Mnh. James, that's not helping! - Don't panic, baby. - Yes. James is very resourceful. He'll work it out. Vrrt! Veet! Vrrt! Vreet! Vrrt! Gzzzh! Jzzt! Bwr! Look, Princess I invented a coin-operated coin screwdrive-e-e-r! See what I mean? Good job, James. Come on, guys. Let's take inventory of the emergency gear. Lucky coin strikes again!  Hey, Preebros, I know things seem bad, but I'll figure out a plan. I know, Finn. Dude, I found us some flares! I saved us! Right on! Hey, dudes, the radio is fixed! Good grod! I love you, James! I knew you could do it, James! You know, James, I wasn't sure about you at first, but you're okay. Thanks, Jake. I wasn't sure about you, either. Chk-chk. - BUBBLEGUM: James the radio's still not working!  I'm not getting any signal. What the skunk?  James, it's all sanched up! James is like, "wha?!" It was working just a second ago, I swears! I went, like, "choo-choo-choo!" And the radio was like, "pch-choo-whichoo-whichoo- whichoo-whichoo," and then I was like I take it back. This guy's totally cuckoo! This is my cuckoo face. He did his best, you guys. Right, right. Okay, time for plan "B." James, pass me them flares. Chk-oo! Boop! A flare for my liege. James, where are the flares? What?! May maybe they're, uh, invisible flares.  Finn, PB, can I speak to you in the other room, please? You want to do this trust-huddle style, buddy? Mm. So, what's all the hubbub? What's up with that James dude? Yeah. Do you think James could be breaking things on purpose? No. James wouldn't do that. Wake up! Dude's a saboteur. - It's not James. - What's not James? I got lonely up front. I wanted to see what y'all are up to. Hey, that gives me an idea. Me, too! Vrrt! Just kidding! I don't have any ideas. Diversion. D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Diversion. Time to set up a diversion.   - You see anything, bruddah? - Ah, I got bunkus. Wait. If we jam up to that cliff face, I think we can climb Whoop. More goo bros.  What the   Yah! That won't hold them for long. It can't end like this. I got a lady and five kids! I thought I'd outlive at least one of them! Here, man. Take this. JAKE: Your lucky coin? Yeah, man. It always keeps me calm. Who shot that flare, James? We don't have time to point fingers.  You're right. There's only one way out of this jam. One of us has to eat the big one so the others can survive. And I'm gonna be that one. I'll run up there, get the creatures to chase me, and while they're busy noshing on my teen-boy body, you three can climb to safety. Don't try to talk me out of it. I got crystal certainty. This is what it means to be a he Wha? BUBBLEGUM: James, we need to talk. FINN:  So, what do you say? Sure thing, Princess! Byong! FINN: Ugh! Huh? Why did Jake? Wh-Where's James? JAMES: Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!  FINN: James!  Aah! James, look out! Ohh. PB! What's going on? Finn, I need to explain something really heavy. I was the one who sabotaged all your escape plans. I calculated the chance of success for every possible escape plan, and none of them were going to work. You said it yourself there was only one way out. Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others. James did something really noble to save us. But I wanted to do it. Why didn't you let me? There's a reason. With this sample of James, I can clone a new one. He's candy, but you're not. I can't clone another you. Whoa. I made the best choice available. James served the candy kingdom on a dangerous mission, and even though he is gone, and it's super sad, I would like to honor James with this new James I whipped up in the lab! Jeet! Here you go, James an award for bravery. Let's hear it for James!  Is this right or wrong? I can't tell. Hey, cool. Did I do something cool? Do I do something cool? I don't know, man. Here's your coin, James. Gzzt! Wow! This day keeps getting better and better! Ehh. Vrrt. Vrrt. Vrrt. Vrrt. Vrrt. Vrrt. ALL: Vrrt. Vrrt. Vrrt. Vrrt. Vrrt. Vrrt.  Come along with me  And the butterflies and bees We can wander through the forest And do so as we please Come along with me To a cliff under a tree  This party is so crazy!


     Ha ha ha. Take that, Master Chen. FINN: Jake? JAKE: What? Jake, did you hide my sock? No, man. I told you -- I don't do that kind of stuff anymore. So, what? It just magically disappeared? I don't know. Maybe. Is that just a cute way of saying you took it? No! Why don't you just help me find my sock? Oh, Finn lost his sock! Everybody stop what you're doing and help Finn find his precious sock!  BMO: It looked like a tough case to crack, but I hate to see good friends fight. So I decide to take the case.   Hmm.  Ronnie.  It looked like I had a guilty mouse.   Hello, Ronnie.  What do you want, BMO?  Where is Finn's sock? I don't know what you're talking about, BMO. I didn't do nothing. Leave me alone!  I knew that lipstick anywhere. How is Lorraine? You stay away from her! She's with me now. Do you hear? Calm down, big guy. Me and Lorraine are dinosaur bones. Good. 'Cause I would be so jealous.  Just tell me where the sock is, and I will let you go. I don't know, man. What if I put some knuckle in your eyeballs? Would that help you think?  Okay! Okay! Um it looks like a grape-juice stain on his sock. Check the pantry. Of course, I didn't trust Ronnie. But I had no other leads. Maybe the grape juice had some secrets to tell me. Or maybe Ronnie was just pulling my hair.  Ugh. Just as I thought -- not even opened. I fell right into his trap. Let me out, you!  I will get you! Piece of you, Ronnie! Oof! Oh. Officer Davis. Thank goodness. I--  BMO, what are you doing here? Looking for Finn's sock -- same as you. We got this under control. Stay out of police business, or you will be the one behind bars. I didn't listen to that cop. I needed to find Ronnie. And I knew just the lady who could lead me to him.  She looked as beautiful as ever.  Where is the sock, Lorraine?  What makes you think I know? I saw your lipstick on his fur, so don't act so cute. It sounds like somebody's jealous, no? Don't count on it, Lorraine. Now, tell me where Ronnie is. Ha! You think it was Ronnie? Maybe if he was man enough to steal a sock, I wouldn't have spent my nights with Bebe. Bebe?! So you are saying Bebe is man enough? What? No. You are putting words in my mouth. Bebe doesn't know anything about Finn's sock.  Finn's sock? How do you know it was Finn's sock? I never said whose sock was stolen, Lorraine. I, um, um I heard it on the TV news. No dice, sweet beak. Officer Davis has this case under tight wraps. Uh, uh fine! Bebe stole the sock! Okay? Oh, BMO. Can't you just forget about it? Sorry, lady. Forgetting ain't in my job description.  Does this mean you still remember us? Ha ha. Same old Lorraine. Well, don't tell Ronnie about me and Bebe. You know how he gets when he's jealous.  Bebe owned Bebe's, a dance club downtown. He yells at ladies. Wake up, brainiac.  BMO? Aah! Aah! Arrgh! Where is the sock, Bebe? Uh  I don't know nothin' 'bout socks! Don't play dumb, Bebe. Don't play dumb with me.  I talked to Lorraine, Bebe. She sold you out, dum-dum. No! She -- she wouldn't do that! It wasn't me! I swear! It was Ronnie! Ronnie? But why? I don't know, man. I don't know.  Oh, Lorraine.  I'm gonna go wash this schmutz off my grabbers. When I get back, you better start talking sense. It wasn't adding up. Why would Ronnie swipe the sock? And why would Lorraine finger Bebe? Sure, he's a dirtbag born out of a mother, but who's not? I don't really get it. Maybe it was time to cut my losses. Come on, Bebe. Let's get you cleaned up. Bebe? Bebe! Dead! This doesn't look good. I better hightail it! -  - Huh?! The cops! It was a setup!  Oh. Oh, no. Bang, bang! Pyoo! Pyoo! Pyoo! Whoa! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ohh ugh JAKE: Hey, has anyone seen BMO? BMO! Where's BMO? Hello? With the lipstick, she looked as beautiful as ever. I'm worried about BMO. This is real. BMO! Who's BMO?  Hello?  Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey, BMO. Wake up, buddy. Are you all right? NEPTR? I feel like I got hit with a Dracula by King Kong. Whoa. Sorry, man. You want some pie or something? Sorry. I gotta run. The cops are after me. Have you seen any down here? Nah. No one's been down here all day, except me, you, and Ronnie. What?! What was Ronnie doing down here? I don't know. But now my sensors indicate that some treasure is missing.  About a sock's worth.  That's it! That's why Ronnie took the sock -- to carry stolen treasure in with! He had to whack Bebe to keep him from squealing. Then, he pinned the rap on me. Bebe's dead? Listen, NEPTR, you better lay low for a while. I'm gonna go find Ronnie. I've got a score to settle. Hey, BMO. We should hang out more. We're both robots. No, NEPTR. I am not like you.  - Ronnie? - Evening, BMO.  Don't worry, buddy. You're off the hook. We know it was Ronnie who killed Bebe and snatched the treasure.  We found this confession on him after the shootout. Hmm. What about the sock? Forget the sock, BMO. The case is closed. Let it go, buddy. It's over. Maybe he was right, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that, somehow, this case had slipped right through my fingers. Lipstick?   Ohh! Ohh!  Lorraine! BMO? Get back here with that treasure, Lorraine! Sorry, BMO. I earned this loot. Those chumps were not framing themselves. See you around, BMO. Lorraine! Wait! What about the sock, Lorraine? Oh. That old thing? I hid that where no one would ever find it -- in our secret grown-up kissing spot. Remember? -  It was good to see you again, BMO. 'Til next time.  'Til next time, Lorraine. You see, man? That was really fun. You don't need two socks to have fun. Yeah. I guess. But maybe it would have been more fun with two socks.  Finn! Finn! I know where your sock is. Huh? It was in your pillow this whole time. See? Whoa!  Right on, BMO! Ronnie the Mouse stole it, but Lorraine Chicken set him up to kill Bebe. But the flatfoots busted Ronnie, and Lorraine skedaddled with the loot. But BMO solved the case! Yay, BMO! Yeah! Yeah! Yay, BMO! Yay! Yay, BMO! Our chicken's name is Lorraine? She's red-hot like pizza supper. PRINCESS BUBBLEGUM: My King. My King? Wake up, husband.  What? ALL: Long live the King! What is going on?  Mm. Not much. ALL: Long live the King! Huh?!  Wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah Hey. Do I know you? wuah-wuah-wuah -- Hey. I-I know that guy. He doesn't know he's dreaming. Huh?  Huh?! Come on, honey. Eat your soup. Huh? Wait. Wait, wait. Eat it now! Mmm. Mmm. Mmm!  What kind of -- Aah! Howdid we get here?  Uh I'm good on the soup. Huh? You! You haven't much time, sir. What?! You are trapped in a dream, and you are in danger.  You need to find this worm and break it. Find the worm? Butyou've got him right there.  Satori!  Huh? Huh? Huh? Come on. Jake? Ohh!  Pfllllll! Pfllllll!  Hold down the tape until it fully sticks to the paper. Like this? Yes. But now try holding it higher. Like this? You need more tape.  Use this. Now tape the bottom.  Who's it for? Who's it for? It's for, um Pfllllll!  It's for me! Play this. Umokay.  The worm!  The worm! Wo-o-o-o-rm! Worm! Woiiiim! Worm! Finn! Aw, man! Is it really you? Jake? Yeah. I think so. Yup. I'm trapped in this dream, and I can't wake up. Me too. I was just in some other part of the dream with Princess Bubblegum and Flame Princess. Make-out dreams? Nice! What?! No, it wasn't like that. Hey, I won't judge. Uueeeggghhhhh! Lady's got two mouths. Mm-hmm. I don't think she's real. Weird.  Ouch! What was that for?! Just wanted to make sure you were real. Our dreams must be linked, for some reason. Whoa! Well, Pep But told me we got to find that worm that crawled through that hole and break it.  In my dream --  In my dream, suddenly, an unimaginably amazing sword appeared in front of me, able to blast the hole open.  Rad! I usually dream of messed-up stuff, like a shark trying to bite off my face. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! -  - FINN: Oh! Oh! Careful! If you grunk up the dreamscape with your subconscious fears, the whole thing will blow apart. Ohhhh. Just shrink down, like me.  And then, I shrunk down, like Jake. How come you know so much about dreams and stuff? 'Cause I sleep a lot.  Oh, yeah. Fionna! Cake! I need your help! What?! What did you say? I really did it this time. They're loose, and they're coming for us! Who?  BOTH: Aaaah! Aah! Dad? Help us! Maybe he's not really real. Dad? Are you okay?  That scarf looks familiar. Yeah.  Man! The worm is fast! Yeah, it's nuts -- fast as nuts. Well, let's catch it with Some big ol' legs! Well, that's kind of boring for me 'cause that's my normal power, you know? Then you get birds!  Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi! Remember -- this is just a dream. Keep climbing. Now what? Break it. Pshhh!  Gah! Gah!  Jake! Are you okay? Yeah. Are you? Yeah. I'm okay. BOTH: We did it! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Hmm. Was that -- was that mirror always like that? I'm pretty sure this is not normal. Nah. It's fine. Aah! Jake? I think we're still dreaming. Nah, it's just dream residue. Forget about it. You sure know a lot about dream stuff. Hmm. You pinched me earlier, but I never pinched you. Everything's normal. Everything's normal.  It's still a dream. Hmm. Huh?! Hey, guys.  Hey, guys.  Hyah! Ha ha. Why are you janking up my dreamscape?! Listen, don't worry about it. What?! You can't defeat me. I'm the King Worm. I'm going to keep you in this dreamscape until I've consumed all your life energy. My life energy?! I use that! Huuaahhh Wait. Something's wrong. I'm missing something. Wait. Something's wrong. I'm missing something. - Worm! something's wrong. I'm missing something. - Worm! Oh, man. - Worm! I'm gonna be stuck here -- forever. Ouch! Hey, guys.  Hey, guys. Knock it off. Huh? Psst! If you grunk up the dreamscape with your subconscious fears, the whole thing will blow apart. Hmm? Oh, yeah. Thanks, dream Jake!  Get ready to eat it! Wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah Okay, Finn. Concentrate.  Deepest gut fears!  Oh, gross! The ocean. Aah! Yah! Aaah! Yaah! Yaaaaaaaaaaah!  Okay. Okay, that wasn't so bad. -  Aah! Oh, grob! The Lich! Aah!  Hey, why don't you sit down or pass out or something? Never! Bubblegum! Waa-hooo! Finn! Shush! I'm having coffee with the Lich. You wouldn't understand.  You're too young! Bleahh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Aah! So much screaming! Yaah! Aaah! Aaaah!  Hadenough destabilization? I don't  know what you're talking about. I'm a clown-ning-ning-ning. Eep! Well, that's that. Wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah  I don't feel so good.  Get out of our house, King Worm!  Is it really you this time? Yeah, mans -- actual Jake. Cool Pinch. Ow! Man, come on! I'm just checking. Just checking.    


     BUBBLEGUM: In the kingdom of Ooo, there is a galaxy of flavors, but only one taste sensation is amazing enough to kill for -- the Royal Tart. Royal Tarts are very rare. They are only eaten at the most sacred gathering in Ooo -- The Annual Back-rubbing Ceremony. The tart is so legendary that countless thieves will risk their lives for just one bite. My head will be decapitated if the tarts don't make it to the ceremony. I only trust one guy to deliver them -- the Royal Tart Toter. BOTH: Oh! He's magnificent! He used to be, but he's gone mad and old. So he can't deliver the tarts anymore. Cinnamon Bun offered to fill the position, but he's kind of half-baked. CINNAMON BUN: Hey, Princess! Here I go!  I'm stuck. Princess, let us deliver the tarts. Are you sure, Finn? This is really important. FINN: Princess, I have never been more sure of anything in my whole life. I'll do anything it takes to keep you alive and safe. We won't let you down. Well I accept your offer.  Welcome to the tarttorium! Wow! BOTH: They're so beautiful. No, boys. Those are the reject tarts, full of imperfections. These are the perfect tarts  safely packed into one of my antigravity tote chambers. BOTH: Tote sweet! Now, I want you to tote those tarts through that tunnel. The Royal Tart path takes you directly to the Royal Congressional Hall in the Badlands. The path is really safe and well protected, but keep your eyes peeled for any sign of danger, okay? Mm-hmm. Yep. Good. Now, here's your map. Hey, Princess, what are all these bubbling chemicals all over the place? That's paralyzing potion, Finn! Don't touch it. It'll paralyze you forever!  Oh. Thank you, boys. And remember, my head is on the line. All right. Let's hit it. Wait. I got a sick plan. Go! Okay. Bye! Bye-bye! Bye-bye, now! - Goodbye! - Bye! Bye! Ha! That was fun. But Why'd you do it? Look, everyone expects the tarts to be on that Royal Tart path. Cinnamon Bun will be our decoy while we take the one path no thief would expect a tart toter to take -- the desert of doom! JAKE: I guess this is it. Huh. Not as scary as I thought it'd be. Yeah, man. Mostly, it just looks empty. I mean, what thief would ever hang out here? There's nothing to steal. You know, I think my plan might be kind of brilliant. I mean, I'm not saying Mn brilliant, but it's a pretty brilliant plan, I think. JAKE: True, true. This place is perfect for totin' tarts. Yeah, and the back-rubbing ceremony is right over those mountains. This tart tote is gonna be a total cakewalk.  Yeah. Whoa! Wait! Hold up! What is it'? Shh!  It's a campfire -- close by.  Does it smell like a tart thief s campfire? Maybe. We better check it out. Can't be too careful. D-don't burn it, now, Grimby. Hush.  I ain't gonna burn it. Crud! I was sure we'd be safe in the desert of doom. What? What you saying? Those are dirty tart burglars. I think they're just dirty hobos. No, man. They are cold-blooded tart destroyers, and we have to get them before they get us. Why'? They're gonna kill Princess Bubblegum by stealing our tarts. Oh, yeah. But how come J.J. gets to hold it, Grimby? Aah! Ooh. Ow. Yeah! Go on! Get! We'll mess you up crazy! You, listen up and tell your friends -- the next time you want to steal one of our tarts --  You got tarts? You know we do! And the next time you want to steal one, you picture this guy right here chewing on your brain.  What the that thing's getting the tarts! Son of a  GRIMBY: We're eating good tonight! Uh-oh. Man, he got like five or six. But my brilliant plan. HOLO- PENDANT: Incoming transmission from Princess Bubblegum. What the BUBBLEGUM: Hey, Finn.  I'm just checking in using the Holo-pendant. How are my tarts doing? They're, um t-they're -- they're -- They're radical! No tart problems here. Uh, yeah, right. Everythings, uh, bazoobs.  Oh, look -- Uh, somethings eclipsing the sun. It's so dark now. Finn? Finn?!  Oh, well  I'll see you soon enough. HOLO-PENDANT: Transmission complete. JAKE: I think the plan went awry. No. All this was just some freak bad luck. But we still got some tarts, and the princess is still safe. Oh, yeah. And who knows what kind of freaky things might have happened if we took the Royal Tart path?  Old Cinnamon Sun's probably got his hands full. Bye. Goodbye. Bye-bye. - Hello. - Hello. Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay.  Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. FINN: You know what? Even though it totally wasn't our fault, it's probably for the best that we lost those tarts. Huh? How? Well, it's like a reminder to really stay sharp and play it extra safe. For instance, take this scary cavern here. No sane person would ever bring a tart down there, so So no thieves. Exactly. You are on a roll today, buddy. FINN: Pee-yew! JAKE: Yeah, pee-yew!  - FINN: Jake? - JAKE: Yeah? FINN: Hey, man, did you just, like, sniff my butt? JAKE: Uh, just now? FINN: Yeah. JAKE: No. FINN: Huh. All right.  JAKE: Hmm. Hey, Finn? FINN: Yeah, Jake? JAKE: Did you just, uh, lick me all the way up my arm? FINN: No. JAKE: Hmm. Strange. FINN: Jake, let me see those matches.   Uh-oh. Man, we got got. There's only two left! What?!  Aah! HOLO- PENDANT: Incoming transmission from Princess Bubblegum. BUBBLEGUM: Hello? We blew it, man. My plan sucked. It sucked all along, but I was blinded by my hubris. Now PB's gonna get got, and it's all my fault. Whoa, whoa. Take it easy, buddy. We've still got two whole tarts left. PB is gonna be fine.  You really think so? Yeah, why not? Hey! Keep off them tarts! Huh? I said back off of them tarts. Are you an imbecile? But I -- right the bazoobs now! Finn, he's got a laser gun! Yeah! That's it. All right. Now I got to book it to Nana's for brunch. See youse later. It's over. PB's gonna get croaked. Mmyeah, or we could smash in there and stop Congress from chopping her head off. You're right! Jake, let's go save Princess Bubblegum!  No! Aah! Huh? Another perfectly chopped tart!  Let the Annual Back-rubbing Ceremony begin. Dude, they're just slicing tarts. And there's Cinnamon Bun over there! Hey! He must have delivered the decoys. BOTH: The ones we poisoned! No! Princess, don't eat that tart! Okay. Geez, Finn, I won't eat that tart. I'll eat this other tart instead! Oh, Princess, no! The princess has been paralyzed. I'm not paralyzed. I'm gripped with the flavor! That means we must have been carrying the poisoned tarts all along.  Yep, all part of my master plan. Pbht! Whatever, man.  BUBBLEGUM: Excuse me. What is this about poisoned tarts and alternate plans? I-I -- all right. Here it comes. I had a brilliant plan to tote the tarts along a dangerous path, but I mucked it up.  You ought to give this toter job to Cinnamon Bun. He's the real hero. Yeah! I'm sorry for not following your instructions and for lying to you about it. Oh, Finn, I forgive you, 'cause I lied to you, too. They weren't going to decapitate me. I just said that so you guys wouldn't eat the tarts. Oh. So I guess we're even. Uh, yeah. I guess so.  OLD MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, the Royal Tarts have arrived.  The old tart toter. Nobody move. He can't see or hear, but he can feel your movement. Hello? Eat my tarts'? This cosmic dance of bursting decadence and withheld permissions twists all our arms collectively, but if sweetness can win -- and it can -- then I'll still be here tomorrow to high-five you yesterday, my friend. Peace. Sheesh.  


    So, then Melissa's like, "what do you think of him?" And I'm all, "well, he's no ray of sunshine or whatever." Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! You know these people you just get, like, neggy vibes from? Yeah, like bad jubies or something. Totally. They just put everyone in a wack mood with their bad jubies. Whoops. Oh, man. My body feels weird. Uh, dude, that's 'cause you just got glide-sliced by the ice duo. Heh, heh, heh. Yeah, my body feels weird, too. - Here, Finn, feel this. - Ah! -  - Whoa! Too much electricity to the noggin, bro. - He'll be fine. -  Oh! - See? Fine. - Heh! That was  weird.  This is a storm alert from the automated weather service in effect for the grasslands and all surrounding areas. Residents must evacuate or seek shelter immediately. Wait, what?! And now your local forecast. Today, expect stormnado winds and an impending monsoonami, flurricanes possible. Chance of survival 29%. How long's this gonna last, man?  A whole week!?  What do we do?!

Where you getting all that food, LSP? I took it from that guy's house. What?! Chill, homie. Nobody's there. It's, like, abandoned or something. Yeah? Oh-kay. BMO, what is the deal with Jake? Oh, he's down by the river. But shouldn't he be helping us? My arms are already, like, super-tired from carrying all those bags of chips. This isn't fair!  Oh, okay. The BMO will talk to him. Hmph! Water bot! I am the water bot! I have a water body!  Oops!  I will never know the pleasures of skinny dipping. Jake! Hey, there, buddy.  BMO: Jake! Jake! There you are! The storm is getting closer. Look!  We need your help. Well  the thing is, I've been working on this thing, and I've been collecting, like, lots of stuff. Um, I just can't really show anybody yet. But trust me, man, it'll be great, I promise. But but Jake, I don't see anything here. You're thinking too much with those eyeballs, not enough with your mind hole Or whatever computer thingy you got up in there. I'll catch ya later, man! Don't worry.  Nailed it. Lousy Finn and cans Jake making me put these cans on the shelf Unh unh  That's it! Is Jake staying in this bunker or what?! I mean, of course. It's for everyone. But he hasn't lumping done anything! Oh, but he said he was working on something. Get real, BMO! That fool needs to get schooled.  Oh, heck no! Unh-uh! Excuse me! Are you not aware that we are all working our steamy butts off down there so we don't get wiped out by this crazy sky nightmare?! Whoa, whoa. Hold up. I'm working on something up here. It I see nothing! You're working on nothing! Look, LSP, can we just take a moment to appreciate this moment? Look at this crazy sweet sunset. When's the next time you're gonna see a sunset like this? Or any sunset, really? Who knows how long we'll be down there?  Waaaaaah! I obviously love sunsets and cute animals, but we don't have time for this right now! - But I - You know what?  I just can't with you right now. Can't what? Jake! He hates lightning. Ah, Jake, you're back. Yeah. Heh. So, what'd you bring, man? Heard you were working on something big. Well, I've been jotting some stuff down in my notebook. Oh, cool. Like survival tips and junk? No, not really. It's more like um It's a surprise. Oh. So, you didn't bring anything.  Oh, snap! Got to seal the door! BMO, light this baby up. Ooh!  Ooh! Okay. All boarded up. Now we wait. We just wait? That's it? Can we at least play a game or something? I'm already bored. Sure. What game? Spin the bottle. - Yeegh! - Sorry, LSP. Ain't got no bottles. Yes, we do.  Yo, what gives? We got to ration that water! I have needs, Finn!  Just sit there, then. I'll be texting Brad until you change your min And that's why you should never rely on technology. No offense, BMO. Is she okay? Yeah, I think she's already asleep. Hey, you guys hungry? - Mm-hmm. - Hungry Yo, LSP, throw me some chips. No more chips. How about some of them bean-beans? No. No more. Looks like we got a can of, like, beet something. Wait, what? Is that all that's left? I was hungies! You ate all the food?! I can't believe you! Whatever, Finn. I'm not here to make friends.  I'm here to not die.  Aah!  Finn, the door! You were supposed to secure the door! BMO, you saw me do it! That wood must be bunk or something! Yeah, I think this food's bunk, too. It expires in Oh, glob! Aaaah! I knew raiding that house was a bad idea. Well, maybe maybe I could've built something better if I had some help from, oh, I don't know, my best friend! - Aaah! -  Nooo! BMO!  What'd I miss?! Why is it dark now? Yeah, I broke it. Whatever. Guys, I think this storm is more than just some scary clouds and weather junk. We've been treating each other like ding-dongs since we've been down here. Duh! This bunker is the worst! Nah, nah. I think this storm's carrying some Major negative energy or something. Bad jubies. It's making us all go nanners! I think I can help, though. Let me show you what I've been working on.   It is so beautiful!    Holy tornado twins!  Peek-a-boo! I'mma hurt you! - No! - Don't hurt us! But I only feel good about myself when I knock other people down!  I told you, man! This storm's got an attitude problem! Jake, you got to help us get back to our happy place. The only way to fight bad jubies is with good jubies! Aah! Finn, I can't keep this up solo! But we can't make all those sounds! No time to be self-conscious, man!  Get on this beat!  Swish! Swish! Brrn-ka! Swish! Swish!  Caw! C-caw! Whoa! Tweet! Tweet! Tweet! Tweet! Tweet! What are those noises?! The sound of good vibes! Yeah! The dope beats of life!  It makes me feel some type of way. How about you pause that stormin' for a sec so you can hear the rest of it? Wait. Wait, wait. That one. Wh-wh-what's that one?  No, no, no. That "tweet tweet" one.  Yes! Ohh I haven't heard that sound since I was a baby breeze. What? You forgot what a bird sounds like? No wonder you're depressed! You know, you should really stop and slow down more often. Yeah. You get to hear life happening. Makes you feel good.  Ahhhh. You're right! I've been a freaky storm for so long that I forgot it's okay to be a breeze sometimes. I-if you'll excuse me, I'm going to explore the rest of this beautiful day. Wait! Here, man. Take my notebook. It's got the sheet music to my jam. Really? You would do that? Yeah, just take it.  Thank you so much, stretchy dog. This is one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me. Outey! Yes! The sun! Hoo-hoo! I am sorry we doubted you, Jake. Ditto. Proud of you, man.  Aah!


  Finn to Prubs. Come in, Prubs. Hey, Finn! How's the mission going? So far, no sign of the Birdman. Why's this guy so dangerous? Some say he's a half man/half bird that poops fire while he flies. It's all rumors so far. That's why I need you and Jake to find out everything you can about him and report back to me. Where are you? Under the sea. The mermaids are trying to beach themselves. I came to see why. Turns out, they're just lonely. Ha ha! Maybe I'll go hang out with them after this biz. Sounds great, Finn. Okay. Bye, PB! By-y-y-y-y-e! Come on, let's go look for that creep. Whoa. Huh? Where am I? This is the Rookery, where I and my bird friends dwell. So are you, like, the great birdman? That's what they call me nowadays. But when I first met you, Finn, and you, Jake, you knew me as Xergiok, the Goblin King! Wha-a-a?! When we first met, I was crazy for smacking goblin hams. I was cruel, selfish, brutal. But everything changed after I was defeated by the two of you! So, you got some slick new shades, and now everything's different? Oh, no. My change has been deep. And these whatsits are only curtains for empty windows. Whoa. What happened there? I miffed off a wizard, and he took my eyes. I wonder what he wanted them for some kind of lotion or potion or time-traveling spell. I'll never know. Never. Ever. Never. But losing my eyesight was only the beginning of my wonderful change. I started meditating and doing yoga. Now I can "see" with my heart and smell with my soul. You smell with your beard? I smell with my nose! Lame! Ohmmmmmmmm What are you doing? mmmmmmm Oh, Taffy! You heard my call! Climb aboard, boys. Taffy will take us to the lower level, and you can have a bite to eat. Oh. Uh me and Jake will follow you. Jake needs to stretch out and stuff. Okay, great! Well, follow me! It's crazy, right? The way dude's eyeballs are just hanging there? I know. I almost told him 'cause it was driving me nuts. Yeah! Me too! You think he's got evil intentions behind his reborn star-child act? I don't know. But if he does, I'm gonna find out. Yeah. Me too. Nice and cool down here, isn't it? Aha! Listen to the babies. Num-num time. Aw. Hey, that's cute. There you go, little ones. Suckle, suckle! They're small, but they sure can take a lot out of you. Whoo! Dizzy. Sometimes feeding really wipes me out. I hope you'll excuse me while I refocus my Chi. See you in a while. Now's our chance to do some snooping. Jake! I found his weapon stash. Hmm. What is it? A fighting stick? A dagger? This one's a letter from the hospital. You can read those bumps with your fingers? Yeah, I learned braille from my ex. Your ex was blind? Nah, just cool. "Dear Xergiok, thank you so much for your donation. The kidneys fit great." Well, geez, maybe he has changed his ways. Maybe. Let's keep looking. Doi! Oh! Oh, crease! Psychic links! Cardamon, my friend, I'm coming! Ooh! Aah! Mother of gob! Hold on, Cardi! Okay, here I am, buddy. OI' Xergi's here. Let's see, now. Aw, dang! Wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ng! Wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ng! Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wong! Wha-a-a-a-t?! Shush, Chile! Ah, Finn and Jake, you are here. Where'd you learn that heal spell? I use no magic. I manipulated space with a vibrational chant. You see, now the injury has transferred to me. Ooh, yeah! That hurts, baby! Whooooo! Can't you see, Jake? I love these birds more than I love myself. What am I to the deafening roar of the macrocosmos? Nothing much. Just a vessel to carry the message of friendship to y'all beasts and dirt. Dirt? Yeah. Look. Hello, friends. Go for a ride. Listen, man, about your eyes Yes a wizard stole them. All right. But not Finn, what are you doing, man? Dude, he's changed. Are you sure? Uh, yeah, man. Isn't it kind of obvi? All right. Tell him. Tell me what? Your eyes weren't stolen by a wizard. They're in your beard. All right. Ooh! Where are they? Ohhh! Ohhhhh! Dude, your eyes are in your beard. What? Good job, guys. Goofing on the blind guy real nice! No, man, they're right here. What in my li-i-i-fe?! We didn't tell you 'cause we thought you might still be a Wong Lord. And these aren't grapes, right? No, man. Hmm. Finn and Jake, could you help me onto Cardamon's back? I would like to be high in the clouds, bathed in the pinks and blues of the desert twilight, when I restore my sight. Sure. Okay. Climb aboard! Vanilla! Chocolat! Cinnamon! Agave! All my friends, to the skies!  Far, far above Time standing still Memories are one Same space, same will Now move along Light speed divides Rips all from one It blows my eye holes And fills me with real power Fills me with real power! Power! Power! Power!! Power!!!  Power. How's it feel, man? Oh. Yeah, it's overwhelming. This view takes me back. I always loved the sunset and the silhouettes of my little goblins lined up to receive their spankings! Well, the past is the past. I want to thank you guys for finding my eyes. I don't know where I got that idea about the wizard. You were in the desert a long time, man. Yes 20 years. Nah, it was more like one year and change, dude. Yes, things certainly have changed for me in that time. Say, who's ruling the, uh, Goblin Kingdom since I left? Whisper Dan. Oh. Whisper Dan. That's cool. Cool. Cool. Hey, you guys want a ride back to your crib? Yeah. Sure, man. Yup. Uh, wait. Xergiok, this is the Goblin Kingdom. I know, but I was thinking now that I'm wiser, I could rule as King again. That idea is terrible. Well, you know, I disagree. And I have my army of bird friends, so anyone who disagrees with me should get a spanki-i-i-i-i-i-ng! Hey, Jeff, is that your real laugh? No! It's Xergiok! Oh, Glob! Wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ng! Ah, dang! Aaaaah! Yeah, baby! Come on, man. Are you for real? Attack, birds! Attack!! Where's the butt on this thing? That's sort of like a butt. Yeah! You like that? Huh? Whoa! Wait! Cardamon! Nougat! Stevia! Dang! You lost your friends, dude. Yeah, I feel myself hitting bottom again. Yep. Okay. Here we go. Wo-o-o-wo-wong! Here, Finn take my eyes and bury them forever. I will not need them again. Okay, man. Thanks. Are you gonna be all right, man? It's cool. Bye! Dude, that sucks. I hope he finds peace or something. He's going to the reservoir. Um why is he doing that? Maybe he's thirsty. Oops. I guess he was just sad. Should we save him? Nah, man, he's fine. Whoooooooooooooo! What the? I found a girlfriend! I'm in love! Whoo!  Ha ha ha-a-a-a-a-a   - This party is so crazy!


     BUBBLEGUM:  Whew! Ladies and gentlemen, I have invented time travel. This phasical sphere is flooded with info waves that scan every second, logging every molecule that passes through its volume. I made special gloves for it.  Now check it out! It's logging time!  BUBBLEGUM: I'll set the clock back now. Now I'll push the time-travel button.  BOTH: Aah!  JAKE: Eh, it's not really time travel, though. You just, you know, moved their stuff around. You didn't really manipulate time. Ice king's done it better before with magic. Well, I enjoyed your presentation very much, princess. Thank you for inviting me. BUBBLEGUM: No! For all intents and purposes, they traveled back to an earlier point in their time. JAKE: Eh, I guess, but not really. I mean, ice king did it for real. Guy pulled his fiancÃ©e out of time from a thousand years ago using magic. Hey, time, where's my fiancÃ©e, am I right?  JAKE:  BUBBLEGUM: Jake, don't deny my science! This is a time-travel machine. Hyah! Take me back to when my ex-boyfriend Brad loved me!  BUBBLEGUM: Lsp. What? BUBBLEGUM: Lsp, that's not how it works. It can only rearrange your molecules into a previously logged formation, and you need these gloves. Give them to me. BUBBLEGUM: No. You witch. Give them to me now! BUBBLEGUM: No, I'm sorry, but you need to pull yourself -- you skunk! BUBBLEGUM: Hey! You skunk! You skunk! You pretty skunk! You don't know heartache, with the whole candy kingdom in love with your pretty bubblegum buns! Aah!  BUBBLEGUM: Hear me, lumpy space princess, I will avoid declaring war on the entirety of lumpy space, ruled by your parents, if you apologize to me immediately! I'm sorry-y-y-y-y-y. I'm sorry you're so stupid. BOTH: Whoa!  BUBBLEGUM: Sheesh.  I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China all to myself alone  everyone in here is a loser. Nobody's as good as Brad. Oh, Brad! Why can't I get over you? Have you tried burning an effigy? That's what they do in movies. This isn't a movie, Charlie! It's real life!  Another cucumber water, your majesty?  What? Oh, I-I'm sorry for staring, but, uh, I know you. W-we used to -- everyone knows me. I'm lumpy space princess. No, uh, from high school -- w-we were lab partners. I'm Johnnie. "Ugly Johnnie"? Y-yeah, you used to call me that quite a bit. Yeah. But I can't call you that anymore. Come on. Sit up straight. Let me see them eyes. Mm. Do it. Nope. Can't call you that anymore.  So, what brings you to the candy kingdom, Johnnie? Business, uh, actually. I own my own company, bottling and distributing lumpy gas. Mm-hmm. And I'm up for a big contract, uh, here in the kingdom, which could really help my business "take off," so to speak. That's so cool. You're like your own boss or whatever. To be honest, I'm a little nervous about this meeting tomorrow. Why, Johnnie? I'm bad at talking to people. That's because you have poor posture. Really? You got to stop slouching. Now look me in the eye! Yeah, stay like that. Boy, lsp.  You sure are making me feel good about myself. You feeling good makes me feel good, Johnnie. So, where are you staying while you're in town? I'm subletting a friend's apartment. Talk is cheap, Johnnie. You should take me there.  That chair? Oh, it used to be over there, but I moved it. Johnnie, it's so nice. You've really made it your own. Thanks. Ooh! Records!  Okay, want to see something funny? Yeah. Okay.  Okay. Sit down. Okay, are you ready?  Yeah.  Okay!  It's his face, but on your body. I know! That's the joke! My friend Melissa and I came up with that.  You're smart that you get it. Boy, when this evening started, I was feeling so dump trucks, but now it's like a hundred forklifts! I feel the same way, Johnnie. Do you feel this couch?  What? 'Cause it's where you're gonna sleep!  Seriously, it's getting late, and I don't want you walking home, so I insist. I'll be in the other room, sleeping peacefully And dreaming about you. Johnnie! Thank you for everything. Johnnie. Go to bed already. You have a big day tomorrow. Good night.  Rise and shine! I hope you like pancakes, 'cause I got Oh. I guess she'll be the one who got away. Looking for someone? You're still here! 'Course I am. Now make me some breakfast. Okay, Johnnie, good luck at your meeting, and remember, I'll be right over there sending you good vibes while you're wowing princess bubblegum.  Sending you good vibes. Yo. Why are you so confident, man? Aren't you nervous to meet the princess? Nope. My g.F. Is back at my place, sending me good vibes.  Johnnie's friend has so many movie channels. Ha-ha! That movie was so dumb. Oh, poop! Johnnie's meeting! Wonder how it went.  Johnnie!  Oh, Johnnie, you're home! How'd it go?! Oh, don't keep me in suspense, Johnnie! I did it, babe! I landed the sale! Johnnie, that's wonderful! And I couldn't have done it without you. I know! And here's the best part -- she wants me back at the castle tonight to go over the contracts during a royal dinner. Oh, my glob! It's gonna be so nice to have dinner inside the castle. It's been awhile. Oh. No. I-it's a business meeting, not social -- just me and the princess, I'm afraid. What?! Lsp? So, bubblegum thinks she can horn in on my territory, sip from my soup after I cut all the onions? Yo, think again, tranch. Who -- who are you talking to? BUBBLEGUM: So, how are you enjoying your time in the candy kingdom? Oh, it's just great. I met this amazing purple girl at the candy tavern. BUBBLEGUM: That's wonderful, Johnnie. Now, tell me Oh, Johnnie. "Ugly Johnnie." Through my tender love, you have metamorphed into beautiful Johnnie butterfly.  Every relationship, I gamble with my heart. I go all-in because the payoff is true love. I see you when I close my eyes. And thinking of you makes my mind feel light. All my problems fade away, and I can't help smiling.  To let someone you love go into the arms of another takes a big person. I don't know if I can be that big. Aah. Aah. BUBBLEGUM:  We're under attack! Can I help? BUBBLEGUM: No, hide yourself beneath the tablecloth. There's cyanide-laced gum under the table. Chew it if you hear raiders break down the door. Okay. Hi, Johnnie.  What are you doing here? I'm going to time-travel you back to when we first met at the tavern, back to when you loved me, so we can have a second chance. What?  Aah! BUBBLEGUM: Manfried, where are the banana guards?! Take a chill pill, princess. I handled it. BUBBLEGUM: What did you handle? You know. Someone drove their car in the door, but no one was driving, and it exploded, so I handled it. BUBBLEGUM: Mm.  Don't chew it, don't chew it, don't chew it!   I'd love to get you  Johnnie? Come on. Sit up straight. Let me see them eyes.  Uh BUBBLEGUM: He's not here.  What? But I sent him back. BUBBLEGUM: The sphere would've had to log his molecules before you engaged the time-travel function. Well, then where is he? BUBBLEGUM: I don't know.  Then if he's gone, can you send me back to before I met him so I won't have to remember this heartache?! BUBBLEGUM: If that's what you want. Do it. Do it!  You witch! Give me them to -- what? What? Where are we? BUBBLEGUM: You asked me to use this. Don't touch me! You pretty skunk! You don't know heartache, with the whole candy kingdom in love with your bubblegum buns! BUBBLEGUM:  Yo!  Check, check, one, two! Hey. I'm rap bear. I can rapLike that. Ha-ha! I'm back. It's a battle of rhymes I'm gonna do it this time I'm rap bear my raps are mystical  Quantum physics! Whoo!  Yeah, yeah! JAKE: Boo! That was pre-written! It's so obvious. Take him out, finn! FINN: Off Nope. FINN: Off the dome. Here we go. Uh! I'm-a start it now I'm-a battle now we gonna make a rhyme so I can rap this time I rap for mill-I-ons sesquipedalians Yeah, that was tight. FINN: Whoo!  FINN: Huh? Rap bear, what's wrong, man? How can I be rap bear if I'm not the best? FINN: No way! You are the best. Going up against you was a dream come true. I look up to you, man. You're like -- you're like my hero, rap bear. JAKE: Awesome.  Thank you, fan.  I thought Billy was your hero. FINN: Yeah, but Billy's dead, so Billy.  Ha-ha! Check out these dummies. FINN: Ha-ha! Yeah! You're awesome, Billy! Ha-ha!  You're gonna pay for this, Billy! D'oh! Aah! FINN: Sick.  Billy! I love rap music, but only when it's good rap. Finn! Finn! Finn. FINN: Huh? Who that? I'm canyon, Billy's ex-girlfriend. FINN: Say what?! That's so weird. I was just -- party pat was just like -- JAKE: What's going on here? Who's that? FINN: This is Billy's ex-girlfriend. JAKE: His special lady? No, his ex-girlfriend. JAKE: Aw, man, I'm sorry. Well, I hope you guys get back together. Whoooooop! FINN: Jake's still in denial about Billy. Billy and I broke up four years ago, but I held on to this. FINN:  Billy's loincloth! After Billy died, I couldn't keep it in my place anymore. I heard you guys were friends, so when I saw your name on the rap-battle flier, I thought it would be cool to bring it to you.  Oh, that's some smelly. FINN: Thank you, canyon. I guess I've been in denial, too. Have you been back to Billy's crack? No. I can't. FINN: It's time to go see Billy's crack. Shouldn't Jake be here? FINN: He needs more time. This would mess him up too much.  Fairies! Ohh, they've infested the place. Okay, you guys, out! This is Billy's crack. Billy got aced by the lich. We had dibs on the crack, so beat it! FINN: I'll dib up your brains if you don't respect the mems of Billy. Flimsy threats! Like a tiny blade of grass in a maelstrom, you are. That storm is me, Jordan, lord of the fairies! I ain't afraid of you or this big --  You think you can chump me like that? This breeze feels great, doofus!  All right. FINN: Laters. Um, so, canyon, why did you and Billy break up? Huh? Oh. Well, I loved Billy, and I believed in him, but then Billy stopped believing, and that jammed up our whole deal -- being a top-tier, red-belt power couple. After awhile, all he did was watch movies and play video games. Pretty lame, right? So I bailed. FINN: Even heroes have slumps, bro. Yeah, I know. I heard he was making a comeback, too. What a weird world. Hyah!  Billy! What the FINN: What is it? It looks like Billy's bucket list. FINN: Whoa! Let me see!  Hmm. Looks like he got to most of these. He sure lived a full life. Okay, here's one. Wait. "Tell finn that thing." What the butt is that? I don't know. FINN: Okay, that's gonna bother me forever. Well -- well, here's one more. We should do it for Billy. What's that? Are you sure you're okay? FINN: Aaaaaaaahh! FINN: Holy shram! Whoo!  That was awesome, finn. You know, you remind me of Billy when he was young. FINN: Whoa. So, can I see you sometime? I have a feeling our paths will cross again. Take care, finn. FINN:  "Take canyon on one last ride." Whoops. Unh. What? Another item? You sneaky Billy. "Lie on my back in the ocean." Cool.  Why the ocean, Billy?!  Okay, finn, don't think about your fear. Just jump in there like it's no biggie. Do it for Billy. For Billy! I'm afraid. I'm afraid! Oh, dang. Here he comes! Here comes the fear feaster!  Way to go, finn the coward. Still afraid of the ocean, eh?  You should just give up! You're not a hero. You're a wimp-o! A cringing, cowardly --  Hey, where you going? Fool, I come with. Ha-ha! I'm gonna nosh on your insecurities. Then I'll -- I'll squat on your hopes. So, now what, little boy? Huh? Uh, hey, man, don't do anything stupid. Hey! You're too chicken to face your fears with open eyes? This stank is cheating! FINN: This stank is for Billy.  No! FINN: Aah!  Aaaaaaaaaaahh!  For Billy! Wake up. Wake up! FINN: FINN:  Huh? Whoa! No mortal blade can harm -- what?!  FINN: Was that you, or me? Huh? Hey. Hey. I-I'm doing it!  I'm not afraid of the ocean anymore! I'm doing it, Billy. Billy!  You finished my list. Now I can rest like a great hero. Thank you, finn. FINN: You're welcome. Canyon helped, too. Tell canyon I watch her sleep. Man, love is weird, finn. FINN: I know. Is that the thing you wanted to tell me? No. Goodbye. FINN: Wait. Billy! What? FINN: What's the thing you wanted to tell me? Oh, uh, you must go to the citadel. That's where you father is. FINN: Joshua's not alive. Me and Jake buried him behind the -- not Joshua! Your other dad -- dad the human. FINN: What? Your father, finn. He's alive.  He's alive.  


     Finn: Tickle, tickle, tickle! Jake: Wakey, wakey, wake!  Finn: Yoo yoo yoo yoo yoo yoo!  Ahhh!  Wow. That was really something. Really something. Sure, I'll hold. Thank you for your time. Hello? I'd like to take a few minutes of your time to tell you about an amazing vitamin supplement. But first, just let me ask you, do you ever feel that no matter what you eat, you're still tired and sluggish and  filled with nagging anxiety and doubt and --  Root beer guy, get your head back in the game! Hello, ma'am. I'd like to take a few minutes of your time --  Hello? What we need is to cut out the middle man. Hey, root beer guy. Hey. Dude, we should start our own place. Next stop, lollipop park estates.  This is good. What is this? Candy. Hmm.  Oh, I've got a closing argument tomorrow, root beer guy.  "I knew there was trouble. I could smell it on the hot evening breeze. Fortunately for me, trouble is my favorite thing because I'm Joe milkshake. I kicked down the door with one swift, decisive motion." No. "With one swift and decisive motion, I kicked down the door." No. "The door was kicked down by me swiftly with not many motions but a whole lot of decisiveness was used by me that was apparent to everybody." Ugh.  Bubblegum: Aaaaaaaaaah! Hmm. Bubblegum: What are you doing?!  Let me go! No! Both: Yeah! Jake:  Hey. Hey, are you awake? Not really. Well, this is gonna sound crazy, but I think I saw princess bubblegum get kidnapped, and the perpetrators were that finn and Jake. Okay, sweetie. That sounds like an interesting dream.  But it did happen.  You need to eat something before you go to work, and you can't keep falling asleep at your typewriter. It's bad for your back. Besides, I miss you at night. I'm sorry, sweetie. I couldn't stop thinking about that weird stuff I saw last night when I was peeking through the bushes. Ugh! Peeking through the bushes?! You've been warping your mind with all this mystery stuff. I swear, sometimes I think you love that novel of yours more than you love me. You've been working on it every night for 10 years, and for what?! Look at me, root beer guy! I'm a cherry cream soda, and I have the same needs as any other cherry cream soda or even diet cream soda!  I didn't know what to say, but Joe milkshake never was a talky guy. On my way to work that morning, I decided to take a second look at the crime scene. Hmm.  Lake butterscotch? Hmm. Root beer guy! Root beer guy! Root beer guy! How many bottles of product you sell this month? Zero. Great! We can count to zero! You know, maybe if you'd give me the new leads You haven't earned the new leads.  It's easy to do when you have all the leads. Exactly. Hey, root beer guy. It's all about the leads. Finn: See? I told you! It's candy stucco. Stucco feels great. Jake: Hmm. When you're right, you're right. All right, you two. What were you doing last night with princess bubblegum? Finn: Uh Jake: Hmm We were home last night. Jake: Yeah. We were doing thatThing. Jake: That was a great thing we were doing at home with no other witnesses. Finn: But we're each other's witnesses. Both: Yeah! But I saw you. Finn: Look, man, you didn't see nothin'. Hmph!  Mr. banana guard, you've got to arrest those guys! Come on! These are the guys! They're kidnappers! You have to arrest them and find out where they're hiding princess bubblegum. Jake: Princess bubblegum? She's right around the corner! Oh, princess bubblegum!  Yes?  I think some banana guards wish to speak with you.  Where are those banana guards? Your highness! All: Greetings, your majesty! Your skin is looking lovely today. Jake: Oh, thanks! It's really, really orange! Ugh! Jake: I've been using this new, uh, marmalade spray-on tan. Yeah. Cinnamon bun  Bingo-bango. This was my lucky break. With one decisive motion, I kicked down the door. Jake: So, uh, being tan is my thing now. Quickly, I scanned the room for the -- oh, man. "Caramel court," "cotton candy Crescent." "Lollipop park estates" -- bingo-bang-- aha! Huh? Bingo-bango.  Bonsoir, monsieur.  Would you like me to turn down the bed? Uh, look what I've got. The security tape will show that finn and Jake kidnapped princess bubblegum.  Finn and Jake would never do that! Oh, yeah? Prepare to have your mind blown, after I put this tape in the vcr, just to make sure I got the right one. I'm pretty sure I did!  Hey, yes! This is it! Bubblegum: Aaaaaaaaaah! Bingo-bango! I've got to get to the -- are you in the tub, sweetie? I'm going out! I've got to get this tape to the banana guards or the newspaper or maybe the d.A. Or something. Jake:  Hey, root beer guy. You were not supposed to view this tape. But -- but how did you guys know? I told them. That's right. I did it for us! Oh, this thing is eating you alive, root beer guy! But it's all I've got.  Jake: Hey, this looks kind of personal. Hmph.  Mr. pudding -- well, you can just call me "buck." Uh, buck, those -- no need to be formal here, son. Those guys who were just in here -- can you tell me what they bought? Well, let's see -- a shovel, a saw, some plastic bags, some duct tape, a bludgeon, a mop, rubber gloves. Say, Mr. -- buck, do you know anything about this lake butterscotch? Right nice spot, lake butterscotch -- Miles from where anyone could hear a person scream, if a person were screaming for some reason. Creepy now that I think about it. Nothing up there these days but some abandoned cabins. Nice place to hide a body if you were into that sort of thing. Son, now, what are you doing in my pickup truck?   Yeah? Don't hang up! I'm root beer guy. I'm the guy who kidnapped princess bubblegum. Yeah, yeah. I wrapped her in a carpet -- yeah -- and I'm gonna dump her in lake butterscotch! I'm completely insane!  But you still have time to stop me. Get up to lake butterscotch right now, banana guard.  And I took a boat out after Emergency! Quickly, to lake butterscotch! All: Wee-ooo! Wee--  All: Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Ugh! All: Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Use the licorice lace lasso!  Whoa! Oh, my word! Get those guys! They're my accomplices! Oh. Okay. I got it!  Busted, you boat crimer.  It's Finn and Jake?! Finn: Well, guys It looks like you caught us. Okay, princess. You can come out now. Bubblegum:  Princess! Bubblegum: Mm-dah! Oh, yeah. It is the princess. Bubblegum:  Congratulations! Whee! Whee! You were so good at solving the case. Um, what case? Bubblegum: The fake kidnapping. To test the candy kingdom's security system? We didn't solve that case. Bubblegum: But if you weren't following the clues I left, who was? UmIt's root beer guy. Bubblegum: Then why the jumping Jay is he in handcuffs?! Uh, he went boating. boo-ba-Dee-bee Dee-ba Dee-ba doo doo doo doo doo-doo-doo doo Dee  That was a great night, baby. We haven't danced like that in years. I'm so proud of you, Mr. captain of the banana guards.  Bubblegum: Cinnamon bun! What the heck are you doing out in the woods? I asked you 20 minutes ago to take these drinks around for us. Oh. Oh! "Around for us"! I thought you said "walk to the zoo and back." Bubblegum: Gah!  Bubblegum: Finn, cinnamon bun's gonna tend the juice bar now. I have a special job for you. As ooo's greatest champion, I'm relying on you to keep lumpy space princess from crashing this wedding. I went ahead and deputized you, so, you know, no holds barred. Got it? Finn:  Yeah! Oh. But what about Jake? Bubblegum: Well, honestly, I haven't seen Jake this happy in a while.  I kind of don't want to squash his groove. Jake: Hands off, little piggies! Bubblegum: Knock knock! Hey, tree trunks! Oh, hey, princess. Wow! You look prettier than a sippy cup in a snow bank. Bubblegum:  Thanks, tree trunks. Now listen -- I don't want you to worry about a thing. I've got finn on lsp duty, and we're keeping your ex-husbands, Randy, Danny, and Wyatt, at least until it's time for me to perform the ceremony. Oh, well, uh, princess --  -- I appreciate your generosity, going to all this trouble to hijack my wedding and all, but you can't perform the ceremony. Bubblegum: What?! Why not? Well, I'm sorry, but I just don't recognize your "authority" on such matters. I can only be married by his holiness, the one true king of ooo. Bubblegum: What?! That fraud?! Now, I know his teachings-- bubblegum: That fraud is here?! Uh, why, yes, but --  Oh, dear. Mama, I'm afraid I've offended the princess. Oh, nonsense, baby. She's probably just jealous 'cause you're about to marry such a handsome, fine, saucy man! Oh, but he is a saucy fine bolog-nah factory! Mm-hmm! I'll tell you what.  I'd like to open up that hood, see how the bolog-nah gets made! Mm! Mama, please! Please don't call him a saucy, fine bolog-nah factory! Bolog-nah factory! Bolog-nah factory! Oh! My perfect day! What else could go wrong? Please go on -- describe the next "thought-form." UmI see, like, reddish-green blotches. Ah! Ha ha ha! One year good luck.  Bubblegum: I've waited a long time for this, king of ooo. And now I'm gonna expose you in front of everyone for what you really are. Yay!  H-hey, barkeep, can I have another one of these ciders? Sure!  Hey, little robot, how you doing? I am the best! I love weddings, I love flowers, I love l-o-o-o-o-o-o-ove! Hey, did you know I used to be married to tree trunks? N-o-o-o-o-o-o! Heh, yeah.  It was just me and t.T. We had some wild times back in the day. Did you know I once took her to play tennis? N-o-o-o-o! Yep. Tennis. I took her to one of those, uhPaddles or whatever, you know? No. Yeah, she left me. She said I was stifling her spirit. I mean --  You know, what -- not enough tennis for you?  No It's starting! The ceremony is starting!  LA LA LA LA LA   Oh, no! I'm missing the love! No! UhPlease, stay here. This is cathartic. You're a good listener. Oh. Okay. Sweetie, you look so nice. Shh. Finn: Sounds really sweet.  Lumpy space princess? Is that you? Let me go to this part-y-y-y! Finn: Aah! It's not your party, lsp. Poor finn. Don't you know? Every party Is my party! Finn:  Bubblegum: I'm just gonna look in this guy's blimp, make sure everything's in accordance  With the laws. Psst! Sweetie, what're you doing? Hmm?  Get out of my way, finn! Oh, my glob! You're touching my woman's body! Okay, dear. Now up you come. Don't hurry this. Here we go. Whoa, whoa, kids! Got to finish the ceremony first. Keep the baby in the basket. Everyone at the party get ready 'cause here comes a hot bunch of grapes! Finn:  Aaaaaaaaah! Oh, my glob! We've gathered here on this beautiful day, under my life-giving sun, to celebrate the enjointment of Mr. pig and tree trunks the little elephant. These two weird animals first Oh, I bet some cute weddings are happening over there.  Bmo, you're so nice. Those flowers look really cool. Oh, I've had a hard life. People seem cute. They seem nice. But then when you can't stop crying because they beat you at tennis that one time, they call you a baby! Yeah, cute nice babies. Bmo? Mm-hmm? Bmo, would you move in with me? Do you, Mr. pig, take tree trunks to be your ever-wedded wife, forever following the teachings of me, the true king of ooo? I do. Bubblegum: And do you, tree trunks Do you promise to love Mr. pig forever and spend the next five years with me in my serenity compound, performing simple household repairs, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, in my gated Mountain compound? I Everybody get ready To pay attention to me! I-I-I-I-I-I I-I-I-I-I-I d-- oh! Ev-everybody! Hey! I'm here! Look at my booq -- unh!  Aaaaaaaaaaah!  Ahh! My zep! Bubblegum: Everybody, this wedding is a farce! A criminal farce! Hey, just what are you egging at here? Bubblegum: I'll tell you what I'm egging at. I'm egging at this outdated wedding-officiant license! Oh! Oh, is that what this is about? You must've found that in my back records. I have the up-to-date paperwork right here. Oh! Bubblegum: What? Uh Hey, wait. How did you get that? I could've swore it was locked in my zep. Bubblegum: Nope! Shh! Nope, nope, nope! Stop talking! Go to jail! Oh! Bubblegum: Yeah. Princess bubblegum, you have gone too far. We stand together against your tyranny. Finn: Hey, everybody. Your prison may hold one of us, but it may not hold all of us. Oh, poor tree trunks. Wait. Where's my mama? Has anyone see my -- oh! No, mama! Well, I guess this is it, sweetie.  Oh. Oh, no. The elephant graveyard is calling to me now. Okay, hold your horses. I'm comin'. Wait, tree trunks! Look around! Everyone we care about is all here together. Finn, Uncle Donald, banana guard #1, Jake, Jake Jr., everybody! We could have the ceremony right here. Hey, yeah! King of ooo, will you do the honors?  Are you crazy?! That loopy bird is gonna string me up sideways! You can perform your own dang ceremony! Kingofooo.Com! Oh. Oh, dear. Oh, my gosh. Tree trunks, did you hear? Huh? The king said you could perform your own dang ceremony. Yeah, that really stung. But ButThe king's word is law.  I can perform my own dang ceremony? Jake: Are you up to it, t.T.? I'll try. I guess it's time. A-are you ready? Oh, okay. Um, uh Do you, Mr. pig, take me, tree trunks, to be your beautiful wedded wife? I do. And do I, Mr. pig, take him to be your lawful wedded husband, tree trunks? I do. Then, you You may kiss the bride. Both: Mwah! Bubblegum: Oh, geez. Let 'em all go, banana guard #3. UhWhat? Bubblegum: I just can't stay mad at something so cute. Did she just say "let everyone go"?  Looks like we've got the whole place to ourselves, if you know what I'm saying. Wait. D-don't you think there might be cameras down here? I hope so.  


  Yup! Yeah, totally stuck that landing! Yeah! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Man, it's been so long since I've worn the Jake suit. I forgot how awesome your bod is, bro. Stretchy-arm power! I feel unstoppable! Ba-a-a-a-m! And I don't even feel it! Beemo, throw your plate at me. Okay. Hyah! Yeah, Beemo, show me the stuff! Keep it coming! Hyah! Yeah, Beemo, unleash the beast! Yeah! Unleash the beast! Come on, Beemo, bring it! That's nothing! You're weak, Beemo! Rrrrrrrraah! Ooh. Ooh. Aah! Aah! You okay, Beemo? I am no match for the Jake suit. That's right. Dog, the Jake suit is mad strong. This junk can protect me from anything. Uh, sort of. Wait, bro, what are you doing up here? You know I'm not, like, actual armor, right? Septuple flip off the tree house! No-o-o-o-o! Whoo-hoo! Ride 'em, cowboy! Whoo! Ohh Bam! Huh huh huh You were a little rough with the Jake suit today, bro. You mashed up my doggy bag pretty hard. Why didn't you stop me? When you're in my body, it pushes out my brain, so I have no control. Come on, bro, taking pain is easy. You just have to imagine that every bruise is a hickey from the universe. And everyone wants to get with the universe. I bet you wouldn't be saying that nonsense if I wore you as a suit. I bet I would be saying that nonsense. Okay, bro, let's see how you like it. I'll bring the pain. Do it, bro. Get in here. Yes! Time to bring the pain! Huh? Man, are you kidding? You give up? You have to, like, punch me in the face. Hmm. I thought I was. This is hard. I-I can't even make a fist. How do you control my body so well? Dude, I'm graceful. Mom raised me graceful. Dude, what the Bjork? Hmm. Aha! Here we go. Dream Journal of a Boring Man, Volume 12. Uh, Jake, what are you doing? There's all kinds of pain, Finn. Jake, come on. Don't do this. Ahh. Okay, let's see. Ooh, this one looks good. And it's not too long only seven pages. Okay, here we go. "In my dream, I was eating jasmine rice, but it was also brown rice, and it was also my mother." Ohh. Huh? What where am I? Oh, yeah. Hey, Finn! How long have I been out? I don't know. A couple hours. Say what? Why are you still reading? It's actually not that bad. There's a bunch where he knows he's dreaming. Here let me read you a little. "So, I said to the first guy, 'if everyone in my dream is me, then you are me,' and he said, 'I am who? ' And I said, 'Me.' And he said, 'Who is me? ' And I said, 'You.' And he said, 'What about you? ' And I said, 'No, you."' "It's like he's trying to solve a mystery that doesn't exist." You want me to keep going? No, I'm hungry. Yeah, I'm hungry, too. How about a truce while you go make us some lunch? Oh, I didn't know we were allowed to call truces. I'll totally remember that the next time my doggy bag is hurtling towards a fence post. You know, you could use the opportunity of cooking me food to mess with me. Wait a sec. You just gave me an idea! Yeah? Uh-oh. Oh, look out. You gonna make me something gross? Something spicy? You know I can take it. Ta-da! Meatloaf? That's my favorite dish. Mm-hmm. What did you do to it? I assure you, it's delicious. Okay, well, you're really terrible at this. Yummy. Oh, that's just mean. Admit you're wrong, and you can have some of this delicious meatloaf. No, I'm good. Mmm-hmm-hmm! Special occasion. Special occasion. Special occasion. Jake, that's my special occasion phone. Someone's calling me to tell me about a special occasion. So? So, can you walk me over there? I want to see who it is. Hmph. Special occasion. Special occasion. Oh, it's Flame Princess. I'll talk to her later. I don't want you embarrassing me, or, uh, anything. Jake? Jake, seriously, don't do this. - Tell me I win, dude. - No, absolutely not. All right. Say goodbye to Flame Princess thinking you're cool. I'm gonna embarrass the Bjork out of you. Oh, hey, you came! I got worried 'cause you didn't answer special occasion phone. - My relatives are waiting inside. - What? Well, that's why I called on special occasion phone. All my less-evil family members are here for dinner. Come eat. Finn, this is my family. These are my two younger brothers, my brother who's home from the military, and my judgmental aunt and uncle. Jake, whatever you're about to do, please don't do it.  I'm a tough tootin' baby that can dance like a man I can shake-ah my fanny I can shake-ah my can I'm a tough tootin' baby that can punch-ah your buns Punch-ah your buns I can punch all your buns If you're an evil witch, I will punch you for fun  What are you doing in front of my family?! Hold on, bro. Perhaps it's a custom unknown to us. Nope! Just doing the kind of stuff I do all the time. This is a nightmare come true for me, sister.  Tough tootin' baby Tough tootin' baby  What are you doing?! Don't you want to see more? Oh, my Bjork! No, I don't want to see more! Wait, what's that in your mouth? Jake? - Oops. Busted. Are you controlling Finn? Yeah, I'm causing Finn pain. We have a bet going on. And you made him dance like a baby, semi-nude, in front of my family? Wow, that's pretty hard-core. What? Good luck, Finn. Hope you win. - I will. - Hmph! Hi, Lady. Finn! - I'm right here. - Oh. 'Sup? What's TV doing here? I thought all the kids found apartments. That's my boy mama's basement baby. Oh, it's this bet we're doing. It's not really a bet. It's more like a showdown. I'm trying to get him to admit that it's hard when someone wears you as a suit. How do I win the bet, Lady? Hey, Dad? Why don't you try jumping in a volcano? Hmm. Yes! So, what are we doing, bro? The universe is gonna have a full-on make-out session with you, bro I'm talking minimum tier eight. Behold! Fire wolves? That's your plan? Please. Oh, no, bro. That's just fortuitous circumstance. Allow me to take advantage. Here, pup-pups. You want some kibble? You want steak flavor? - Steaky-steaks? - Aw, my kibble! How you like it, bro? Pretty painful, huh? Eh, whatevs. Ah, forget it. Let's go. Hmm. Looks hot. Oh, yeah, bro. The pain train has arrived at the station. Choo! Choo! I'm ready, bro! Bring it! You're nothing, lava! You're a bum! I can handle you! Look, just say, "stop," and you won't get burned. Never! Okay, bro. This'll pretty much wreck up your whole life, so think about it. Bring it! Yeah, baby, feels good! Love it! Loving that heat on my skull! Okay, I'm gonna lower you some more. It's probably gonna cook up your brain. Oh, yeah, give it to me! Dang, Finn is flipping crazy. This isn't going to do anything. He's never gonna give up. Aah!! What happened? You robbed me of the win! You're right, man my bruises are hickeys from the universe, and I should just accept that. Yeah, boy! In your face! Yeah, in my face. Yeah! Dang it, Finn. Who's ready for rehabilitation? We'll start with full-body immersion therapy. - No! - Yes!    - This party is so crazy!


And when that salsa cloud had you by the tail Ha ha, yeah. And I swung him around into that golden cactus? Man, that was algebraic. Yeah, man, that adventure was tight. Yeah. I can't wait to get back home, though. Yeah, me too! - I need some sleep. - I'm gonna play some "battle wars" with neptr on BMO for an hour, then work on that flier for pb's laser recital and catch up on my correspondence with my pen pal Danny gladiolas from over in maryville. Great minds. And then next what I'm gonna do is I'm Whoop! Finn? Ohh! Oh What the? Man, where's this supposed to be? Uh, excuse me? Sir? Hmm? Oh! You're awake! Oh, that's wonderful! Oh, thanks. Hey, where am I, anyway? Why, this is the famed kingdom of huge, of course. You fell through that crack in my ceiling and landed in a normal-sized pie. Mm-hmm. Well, my friend up top is probs pretty worried about me, so I'd best get going. Can you give me a boost back up to that crack or whatever? Oh-ho-ho! No, no, no. Don't be silly, child. Your friend must be on his way to find you right now. You should wait for him here, or you could miss each other. Hmm. I guess that does make sense. Of course! Besides, you're just in time to witness the chiming of my wondrous clock! It's set to do its chiming in merely an hour's time! "Krimber"? Come! Food boyz! Shower our guest with the kindnesses of huge! We will await the clock's chiming in style and comfort. Dig in, child. There's always more to come! Oh! Apple scruffs! Just wait till you see my clock! Oh, good. You're awake. Good, good, good, good, good. How you feeling? My cabbage aches a little. What happened? Well, here I was, playing some freecell, and then, wow, you fell down the hole. You bounced off parachute 2 and landed on three old walnuts. Parachute? Hole? Walnuts? Fell down? Wait! You mean we're falling right now? Thanks for your help, buddy, but I got to go! Whoa. Hold up! What's your hurry? My friend's still up top. He could be looking for me, or he could be in trouble and every second I'm down here, I'm falling further away. I got to get back! Uh, I think that's a pretty bad idea. You were unconscious while you were falling, remember? So you might have been falling for weeks or even months. Trust me it's possible. This is a very deep hole. If you try to climb out, you could run out of food. But I've got to do something. I feel like you should probably not starve to death so that when your friend comes looking, you're still alive. Hmm You know, I think you're right. Finn is a pretty heroic kid, I got to admit. He'll probably be here in half a gif. Oh, good, good. Well, till then, please make yourself at home. Here, have a walnut. Thanks, man. I'm Jake, by the way. Hi, Jake. I'm 7718. Strange name, I know, but I'm pretty sure. See, I carved it in the floor when I first got down here so I wouldn't forget. But you can call me seven for short. Oh! Oh! So marvelous! Oh! Ooh-hoo-hoo! Ah-ha-ha! Oh. Oh, my. Oh, my. Well, that was actually pretty cool, but I should probably get going. Wh-a-a-a-at?! But how can you leave now? The clock is set to chime again in merely an hour's time! I feel like Jake should've been here by now. I mean, what if he's lost or or hurt? But this is not the huge kingdom way. Sorry, man. I got my mind made up. Thanks for the food, though. Food boyz, seize the child! Ah! I'm sorry, son, but this is for your own good. If you just stay put, all you need will come to you in time, like it has unto me. But you must sit, you must wait. Yes. Yes, tie him up with normal spaghetti and bring him food, yes! Soon you will see, my boy, all good things come to those who wait. It started out as a day like any other. I was a door-to-door sales bear, specializing in candles and playing cards, making my way to the candy kingdom like I'd done 200 times before. I guess my horse got stung by a bee or something, 'cause all of a sudden, he just skronked the math out. We went off-road, and I got thrown back into my wagon. When the shakin' stopped, I crawled out, only to find I was wedged deep in a hole and sinking fast. I had just enough time to rig up a parachute And I've been falling ever since. Sometimes walnuts would fall into the hole and sometimes rain. And I guess that was enough. - Mm. So how did you pass the time? - Well, for a long time, I just waited to be rescued. 599 Mississippi. 3,600 Mississippi. But that was crazy-boring. So then I got really into freecell and things got a lot better. - Freecell? - Yeah, it's like solitaire, - but there's very few unsolvable shuffles. - Mm. It's a great game. Great game. I really love it. But it's nice, you know, to have someone I can play freecell alongside of. Yeah, man. You know, also, I know some other card games we could play. You know, together. I forgot there were games like that. And then there was another time, this was several years back, the clock chimed early and I thought, "oh, boy. Here we go." But it turned out, one of the food boyz had simply gotten wedged under - Finn! - Huh? - Are you listening?! - Of course. - Food boy in the clock. - Huh. Yes Anyway, as I was saying One of the food boyz had gotten himself wedged in the clock's All right, buddy, let's run through this again, 'cause we're only gonna get one shot. When the clock strikes 12:00, I beckon kindly to yonder food boyz. Hey, you guys like clean jokes? Then Chuck some delicious food in their mouths. Having never before known generosity, they'll immediately make me their leader and undo my spaghetti. Ha ha! Then, with a perfectly timed serving tray, I'll deflect the hunter bot's brass arrow. Swift but delicate, the arrow will gain heft via the chandelier bat's filched asparagus. Meanwhile, the serving tray from before has entered phase two, sending Ken mangosteen careening into the clean silverware But also, the asparagus arrow has caused a domino thing of food to happen, culminating in a huge lemon falling! It's not a perfect plan, but with a little luck, I think it's got a good chance. Hey, you guys like clean jokes? - Ha ha! - What the Food boyz, seize the child! - Unh! - Finn?! Finn! There's nowhere to run, Finn. You know you'll never escape. I'm not trying to escape anymore. I'm gonna murder your stupid clock, you psycho! No! - Yep! - Grrrrrrrrrr! Yaaah! Grrr! N-o-o-o-o-o! Crazy interest accumulate figures bigger interest capital time forgotten like stars and naysayers cards and barbs warm scarves to the hothouse take your socks off - Jake! - Oh! Hey, Finn! - Who's your new friend? - He's not my friend! He's bad! - He kidnapped the heck out of me! - Why you What are you gonna do about it?! Maybe I'll go ahead and kidnap you t ohh! Whoo! Ahh Hey, seven Now that you're out of that hole, what's the first thing you want to do? Hmm Oh! I want a giant flippin' hot dog. Mmm! Ugh Don't you know those things are made out of, like, the grossest junk? Man, I don't give a toot!


     Ohh-ohh!   Hello! And keep away from castle lemongrab! How are you today? Mm! I see. Yes. I'm inside my fortified totalitarian city state. Hello. I'm lemongrab. M-m-me too! Ow! Unacceptable.

Whoop! Whoop! Whoop! Whoop! BUBBLEGUM: But read the next three chapters of your geometry text! Well, at least he's street-smart. Okay, dude, we're going on a field trip. This is the lemon earldom perimeter. Unfortunately, there are pacts and treaties preventing me from getting any closer. We should cloak. I know you don't like thinking about castle lemongrab, but it's where your family is. They set you free, and now they're being punished for it. It rips. Look. Remember lemonhope!  I'm going to eat you! No! No! No! I did it! BUBBLEGUM: Do you see? They helped you. You have to help them now. It's your responsibility. No! I don't have to do anything that I don't want to! They set me free! And "free" means I decide what I do, not them, and not you! BUBBLEGUM: Dude, I'm sorry, but that attitude is unacceptable. Oh, I mean Lemonhope? lemonhope's got feet that take him to fun  Lemonhope's got meat that's warm in the sun  lemonhope's got no future plans fully undeterred no shirts, no pants, no won'ts no can'ts my body's free like a little baby bird  Caw!  lemonhope's got legs that'll strut hot struts lemonhope's got thighs that'll pump both butts he-e-e-e-e's got a harp he's got a flute free to strum  ohh!

Weird cloud's still there. Couldn't rain a little, could you, cloud? Huh. What are you gonna do? Freedom not to rain, I guess.  Lemonhope's got meat that's w-warm in the Su-u-n ma lemon'a  Freedom.  Psst. Lemonhope. Hey, that's better. Who are you? My name's phlannel boxingday. And I've been watching you and your hard, hot life in this desert from up there in my cloud trawler. I thought you might need a hand. Mm-hmm. Kid, truth be told, you're looking a little raw. You're totally free to come hang out with me until you're feeling stronger. Hmm. It's your choice.  Let's go, dude. SoRead any good books lately? Oh, I can't read. They tried to teach me in school, but I just faked it. Uh-huh. Uh-oh. Hold that thought, buddy. Looks like a greedlard's picked up our scent. Dang it! He's a fast one. We can't outrun him. But maybe we can drive him off. I need you to play that flute of yours, lemonhope. I saw how you wrassled those scorpions before. Now play that flute with all your might. Keep it up, lemonhope. It's working. He's turning off.  No, wait. He -- he's mad. We've enraged him. His colony's packed. The harp, lemonhope. Quick, quick, quick.  We'll lure the beast into the rocks. No! Phlannel, stop the ship! Stop the ship! What? What for? Stop the shi-I-I-I-p! You see, lemonhope, it's not peeps. It's dosh. Oh. Greedlards eat dosh for food. And 'cause we killed it, we get to keep it all. That's my job, lemonhope. When I'm not out being free and having adventures, I'm killing monsters that eat dosh and then keeping the dosh. And it just so happens that I'm looking for a new apprentice. What do you think about partnering with old phlannel boxingday? Oh, my gosh, phlannel! Yes!  It's a dream come true!  A dream come true!  A dream come true! A dream come true!  Poor little lemonhope throw me a lemon rope is there a home for me and my harp? A place where my friends give me hugs Hey. Hey, what's going on back there? Something don't feel right. Oh, hey! Lemonhope is here! Hey, man, how's it go-- whoa, what the heck?!  Run for it, lemonhope! Run! Run! Come on! Why aren't you running?! Lemonh-o-o-o-pe! Morning, lemonhope. Hey, is there any more white coal down in the hold? More black diamonds equals more love potions. The old three r's, you know what I'm saying? "R-r-romance."  Oh, man, I can't wait for some lo-o-ve. It's been so lo-- oops! Oh. Rats. Oh, well. Hey, don't sweat it, buddy. It wasn't your fault. It's not that, phlannel. I had a bad dream. Again? That's the third time this week.  I'm free now, phlannel, to do all whatevs I ever wanted, but all I think about is my old life. What does it mean? Well, it's true you are free -- free to help the lemon people or leave them be. But a debt unpaid is not easily forgotten, so you are a prisoner still In deinem kopf. Huh. That's what mistress always said, and I didn't even listen. Ah, lemonhope, you're a doer, not a listener. You learn with your hands and heart, not your head. So, what will you do, lemonhope? I'll -- I'll -- I'll go back, andI'll help my people. And maybe I'll feel better.  And how will you do it? Um, with my harp andMy flute! And help from my friend phlannel! Ah, little lemonhope. Of course I'll take you as far as I can, but I can't interfere directly in lemongrab politics. All those old pacts and treaties have me sklonked up tighter than a synthetic zanoit sterilizer bed compressor tube enlarger on garbage day.  Lemonhope's family held in lemongrab's lair saving them will save me, but I am pretty scared Hmm Looking for something? Well, you found me -- fat lemongrab!  Oh, what's that you've got? Oh, your little harp?! But what's this? I've got things in my ears tonight! So now I'm invincible! Play it, lemonhope! What? Uh, uh, speak up, child. I didn't say anything. The harp! Hurry! I'll take care of the rest! What?! The harp, lemonhope! Play it! Oh, the harp! Didn't I just explain? I've got things in my  My -- my -- my things! Let me go! Le me gooooo! The harp, lemonhope! The harp! ALL:  Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! It's -- it's awful! Faster, lemonhope!  Faster, lemonhope! I can't stands no more! Faster!  Hmm?  Coming! Wait, wait, I-I-I'm -- I'm -- I'm coming! Ooh! Hello? H-hello? BUBBLEGUM: You know, I was thinking, lemonhope, maybe you'd like to stay here in lemongrab while lemongrab recovers. Every kingdom needs a champion, and you're a true champion if ever I've seen one. Plus I already set up a little room for you. Is he gonna stay like that? BUBBLEGUM: Like what? Oh!  No, no, no, no, no. Once his brain's and body's re-knit, he should be back to his lonely old self, which seems to be his only stable relationship level. M-m-m-meee! BUBBLEGUM: So will you stay, lemonhope, and help your people once more? Nah, that's okay. BUBBLEGUM: Oh. But I thought I mean, you guys are cool and all, but I mostly came back here so I could stop thinking about y'all all the time. I'll be back when I'm tired of being free. See you in a thousand years, I guess. Peace! FINN: Wow. I really thought he was gonna stay. BUBBLEGUM: Me, too. I even wrote a song about it. FINN:  BUBBLEGUM: Hey, don't laugh. FINN: Let me hear it. BUBBLEGUM:  No, it's terrible. FINN: Come on. BUBBLEGUM: No! FINN: Come on! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! BUBBLEGUM:  Okay, okay.  Young lemonhope born from candy and glue creator of beauty and ugliness, too poor lemonhope I found you in the dark you lived in the bathroom now live in our hearts sweet lemonhope freed by hard sacrifice to live in the kingdom of sugar and spice lost lemonhope longed for freedom above compassion or friendship wisdom or love strong lemonhope risking freedom and health came back for his brothers and for himself safe lemonhope no more will you roam once you were lost and now you're back home

Just got to get this cocoa pipin'. Your loss, man. The dap of the heavens only happens every 20 years.  Oh, man. It's going down.  Okay. Let's watch some stars. Hmm. You missed it. It was honestly a little disappointing. Oh. Okay. Hey, man, I think I hear something weird over there - with my little doggy ears. -  Phew! Oh, my glob! You are killing, Cinnamon Bun! This routine is locked up! Oh! Thank you, princess. You are also killing. You mean flame princess? Naw, man. What I heard didn't sound like her. Give me a peek on there. This is pretty much just a tube. Huh. It's Lemongrab. Uh, Lemongrab?! What's he up to at this time of night? Uh It looks like he's headed for the mountain of Matthew. I hear Beaucoup Spookoo legends about that place. Beaucoup Spookoo, you say? - We should follow him. - Huh? How come you care where Lemongrab goes? He could you know, he could be messing with crazy mystic power at that mountain. It's like seeing a baby playing with dynamite. Plus, seeing flame princess kind of messed me up. Now I got to distract myself with work. Okay, okay. I feel you. Let's do some things. There's his lemon camel. Lemongrease must be inside already. - Whoa! - Come on, man! Nope. Nope. Nuh-unh. Dang it! Quit bustin' my buns! You have no beeswax in the mountain of Matthew, supple yellow dog. But you, plucky adolescent - You have way-cray beeswax. -  - You gonna be okay by yourself? - Yeah, man. Okay. Just gonna sit down over here Not even. Dong it!  Rocks. Dripping water. More rocks. Oh, I'm becoming stressed! - Continue forward. - Hmm? To reach me, you must choose correctly. Aah! Come, Earl of Lemongrab! Let us play the game of catch. - I am eager to relate to you. - Yes. I desire this, as well. - Huh? - Thank you! Thank you all! As your younger, more relatable new ruler, I shall endeavor to undo all the order imposed by my predecessor! -  - I unaccept! No, Lemongrab! You are unacceptable! Prepare to be served in a pitcher by a little child! What a wondrous time you've experienced, and tomorrow there will be more adventures to be had for little lemonsweets. - Ooh, wave farewell! - What a lucky little boy you - are to live so gaily. - Lemonsweets. - Choose. - Ohh! - Lemongrab! - We understand your styles. We are of the same styles. - Eee! Aaaaaaaaaaah! - No! It is my love that he prefers! He is spiteful of your love! Don't hurt him! Ohhh!  What?  No! Ohhh! Aaaah! Ohhhh! I'm inside you! Aaaaah!  Mnh. Sticky.  Gross! Aww! What is this? Aaaah! Why?! Ohh! Shoosh!  Okay.  Whoa! Ohh! Whoa!  Whoa! Whoa! Oh, whoa! Gross! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!  Blackness all over! Rolling in grease! You want to humiliate me?! Whoop!  - Taste the grease, Lemongrab. - Okay. - It's lemony. - Look up, man.  Aaaaaah! - I am grease?! - Lemongrab, where you at?! Uh, cool. To reach me, you must choose correctly. Who's that Matthew? Whuh-oh! Yo, get up, C.B.! This routine's got to be - high-level outside the box! - Hey, Finn, quick Be me, bro! Be me, bro! Oh, yeah! It's time, BMO! - What is it? I can't smell. - Finn cakes, boy! - Yummy! Ooh. - Yo. Dang. Finn cakes. - That's not fair. - Okay. Goodbye, lemongrease. - Goodbye, where? - Goodbye from my grease body into the blackness, where only my pure essence can go! Up-up, BMO. Finn always gets the first Finn cake. - Yo, give me a break. - Pure essence! Eject!  Blorg! Bleject! Lemongrab! Huh? Whoo! Later, spirit bro.  Huh? What the heck am I running on? Oh, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Cool. - Lemongrab, you okay?! - Finn, don't mess me up. - Hi, Finn. - You're Matthew, huh?  Your rep precedes you, bro. - "Proceeds"? - What kind of rep? Some stuff Jake said that I interpreted as negative. Well, ask yourself if that feels right. What do you say, guy? The meat bodies who've journeyed to this mountain have distilled themselves to their original source materials and - now exist in oneness. - Oneness? - That's you, bro? - I keep adding to myself until the second age of terror, when I will emerge in my final form - and restore the world. - That's why you're here, L.G. - To merge with Matthew? - It is one option to know - the ecstasy of my ego death. - Oh. Well, nice knowing you? I mean, I know you got issues. - But you're, uh - I know. - Are you sure, though? - Here's my other option. You see these? Lemonjons? - Uh-oh. - These lemonjons are me, - and I wonder if they can destroy you. - Ooh, boy. - Lemongrab, hold up! - If you are the head that Blooms atop the ziggurat, then the stairs that lead to you must be infinite! Careful with those metaphors, bro! - Infinite stairs are unacceptable! -  - Ohh. Aaaaah! - Ooh! Whoa! Whoa! Geez!  Oh, no, bro! Heck, no, bro! - Aaaah! - Yo! - Smash that Lemongrab! -  - Try it, grease! -  Yes! Pow! Yeah! I got you, bro! Why are you being so opaque about not letting me in there? Well, get out a pen and paper and I'll school you on this biz.  - Gol' ding! - Dude, I was gonna ask - him to move. - Oh. Yo, class, hold on. Uh -  - I'm done! Let's go! - Okay. Here we are. - Bye! Aaaaaah!  Yo, yo! It's grease!


   Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! Birthday! - Yeah! - Yay! Nice job, Mr. Birthday Boy! Thanks. Man, you are like another year older, but you look good like, super good. Yup. Mom and Dad passed down some pretty good genes. Oh, yeah, Mom and Dad. Hey, did Mom and Dad tell you any stories about when you were born? Yay! Birthday story time, please. Well it was a day like any other day There, there, baby. You're going to be a fighter, just like your mother. Yes! Barrel roll. Ugh! Guh. - Steak break. - Let's get started. These steaks are tough and stringy like you. Oh, good one, dear. Hey, after dinner, what do you say we check the ticker-type for new cases? Margaret, you're in a family way now. You should take a backseat from investigations. Oh, come on, Joshua. Even with this ankle-biter, I'm as quick as ever. Sure, my waist is bigger, but that just means more bullets in my ammo belt. You're missing the point, sugar. What if something bad happens? Let's say we're out on the beat, fighting some lowlife. He throws a punch you zig when you should have zagged, and oops! junior takes a knock to the noodle, comes out with a shiner the size of a grapefruit. I can't take that kind of guilt, and neither can you. I can take care of myself just fine. And besides, these babies don't come cheap. We need to work together as a team to bring in the bread. Yeah, you got me there. Now let's get over to that ticker-type and look for some perps. You relax, dear. I got it. Hmm. Let's get a look here. "Vampire girl spotted in the grasslands harassing sheep and cattle." Nope, nope, nope. "Small fire goblin burns down Candy Kingdom forest." Hey, that sounds fun. Let's do that. Wait. Wait. Here's one "Woman's pies go missing in bucolic countryside, where nothing ever happens" The perfect case for my pregnant wife! What? Now let's get an egg in our shoe and beat it.  Oh-oh Oh-oh  - Yes? Hello? - Afternoon, Mrs. Tree trunks. We're Joshua and Margaret of Joshua and Margaret investigations. And this is our boy. We're responding to a wire about missing pies. Oh, yes. A a a monster's been stealing my pies off of the windowsill. A monster, eh? Oh, yes. You can see the monster tracks leading off into the forest. Well, those tracks are as phony as a $3 bill. The monster tracks are very real. My husband told me so. Ohh! Wyatt! Aw! Aw, geez, you got me. What's the big idea, Wyatt? Why'd you burgle your wife's pie? Because it's amazing! Ohh, I can't get enough of it. You could just ask for seconds. But I want thirds and fourths! I want to stop when I want to stop! Oh, Wyatt. Oh, it's the only good part of my day. Well, there you have it the only monster here was this man's appetite for his wife's pie. Oh, no. But the monster is real. He snuck up and rubbed my elbow while I was gardening. And Leftenant Candy Corn said it came in through the window and touched him on the chest. Oh! Oh, now I got myself all scared. W-Won't you check around to make sure no one is out there? Of course. Probably nothing more than a peeper. Ha! These country yokels are all just superstitious. I bet you that old elephant sees a monster a day. Joshua, look something way larger than Wyatt made them. These tracks look real. Hot cram! A peeping monster! Oh, this town would surely put up a collection to nab this guy. Ohh, too bad you're preggo. We gotta pass. Come on, Joshua! What? - Ha ha! - Margaret! Margaret! Wait for pappy! Hmm. The tracks end here. Hey, hey! Beat it, uggos! The peeper! I'll show that peepsie the pepper! Joshua dear, I'm stuck. Joshua, the beast outflanked us! Gads! Boom! Do your worst, you masher. Joshua! Ooh! Ooh! Drop that daddy! Babycakes! Oh, this is all my fault! Uh, yeah, pretty much. Mmm. Mmm. Ahh, good last meal. Okay. Well, I got bit by a monster, a creature of the night. We both know what comes next for me. Just make it snappy, darling. Don't. Don't be melodramatic, Joshua. I've been doing some research. Listen here I think if we can get a sample of that creature's venom, we can use it to synthesize an antidote. Joshua?! Oh! Puddin' pie! Ugh. I'm fine. Just got to pop out and fetch that venom. You're about as fine as a canary in a cat mine! Oof! Hey, where's the fire, kiddo? You stay put. So's I can keep tabs on you. Feel better. Over.  Come in, Margaret. Do you read me? Over. I've got the peep peep's trail. In pursuit. You have to say, "over,"or I think you're still talking. Over. Joshua, I've stumbled upon the beast's lair. Just hang on, honey bunny. Over. Bleh! Stay right there. What?! Ohh! Ooh! Not yet. Come on, come on! Hey! Hup! What? What's your angle, slick? You poison my hubby, then play the innocent? And what's with all this baby paraphernalia? Wait a tick. Are you a baby? Uh-huh. Oh, no! I must've scared the dickens out of you! There, there, baby. I'm so sorry for this! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Joshua, I got the venom! Ohhhhhh! Uh-oh, this baby business is getting serious! Ohh, ohh.  Joshua! Ohh! Ohh! Ohhhhh! Ohhhhh! Margaret, stay away. Something's about to happen! Something's about to happen with me, too! - Aaaaah! - Ohhh! Margaret! Aaaah! Ohhhhh! Shine the light, dear. Yowzers!  Hello, daddy! Hello, mommy It's so nice to be here with you now  Ohhhh! Boy, Jake left a scar on my head the size of a nickel. I'll have to wear a hat now, Margaret. Well, I think you'll look good in one. Are you sure having him next to Jermaine is safe? We don't even know what he is. Of course we do, dear he's our boy. That he is. Yes, we've got one boy that I gave birth to, and one boy you gave birth to. Let's never tell him how it happened. Agreed. And so they never told me. Never told you what? I don't know. They never told me. Ha!  Come along with me  And the butterflies and bees We can wander through the forest And do so as we please Come along with me To a cliff under a tree  This party is so crazy!


      Huh. Is this like eating for you? I don't know about eating, but it feels nice. Hmm. Mm. ICE KING: Hey. You two should get a room. You and that log, not you and Finn. 'Cause you're hugging a log, you weirdo.  Grrrr! Finn. Huh? Let me. Huh?!  Huh? Hey, now. Stay away from me. Shoo! Shoo! Oh!  Oh, so you want to get real, do you? Well, check this. You seeing this?

Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eggs! Gorilla! Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eggs. Jake. Jake. I had an awesome dream. Flame Princess was there. My body was on fire. I think it was inspired by Flame Princess battling Ice King yesterday. Hmm. That's weird. I had a dream, too. I'll tell you about it. So, then paintings were found, and everyone's eyes lit up. Cinnamon Bun smiled and said, "I saw it from miles away."  Man, I need to have that dream again. I have to get Flame Princess to beat down Ice King again. Why'd you pick this spot? Why does anyone do anything? Hmm. Why do they?  Mm? No, thanks.  Suit yourself.  Mm? Hey! I-l-look! Hey, look. There's that big jerk you hate so much, remember?  Hmm? Oh, hey, kids. Fine day for a picnic. Oh, dang. Did you hear that?  I think he's, like, making fun of you. What? Yeah. It's in the tone of his voice. What did you say to me? Uh, uh w-what? W-what did I say?  It is in the tone of your voice. L-look. Just take whatever you want, okay? Take it all. It's all just prunes prunes and liver Frozen, of course.  Ugh!  Bah! You might have what it takes to slap these old jowls, but do you have what it takes to face my just a sec. Legion of Snow Warriors?! Go, fight! Protect me! Oh, boy. I don't like being made fun of, Ice King. I don't like it at all! Whoa!  Oh! Oh, man. Times! I call times!  It's only okay if the person who's making the fun is someone that I'm cool with. We're totes cool. I-I-I'm Ice King. And they do it in a respectful and knowing way. Respect? I got all kinds of respect. Oh, yeah? Then what's with that stupid, smirky face? Smirk? Oh, I-I smirk when I'm nervous. Ugh, bear hug! Whaaah!  And also when I'm about to win!  Boo-yah! And I didn't even get to test out my new fireproof grundies. Put it away, man. You didn't win nothing.  Are you okay? You feel lukewarm. I-I just need to burn a couple of forests or something and get a good night's sleep. Yeah sleep. Milk.  Milk.  Play the sleep jam, BMO.  Mm. What's cooking? Smells good. Wha? Hi-yah! What? Oh, no!  Aah! Aah!  Huh?  Jake! I had another dream! My body was being blasted.  But this time, Ice King was blasting me with ice cubes. Oh! It was awful! And someone else was there. He was just laughing and laughing. He was in the first dream, too, but he was whispering. I couldn't make out what he was saying. Oh, yeah. It was the Cosmic Owl. Pbht! What?! You didn't tell me the Cosmic Owl was there! I couldn't see him last time. Dude, that means it was a prophetic dream. You have to finish the original dream. Cosmic Owl could be whispering something wildly significant! You have to get Flame Princess and Ice King to fight again so you can see the end of the dream. Make them fight! Aah! Do it now! Aaaah! Dear Ice King, you smell like stink. You're unpleasant, you're not funny, you're old blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Sincerely, love, Flame Princess. P.S. Let us fight. Aaaah!

Flame Princess fight Ice King. FINN: Ice King. What? Ooh! Beard mail! "Dear Ice King, you're not funny, you're old, and no Princess will ever marry you ever, Simple Simon." Oh, fight. Flame Princess! Huh? "Dear Flame Princess, your feet smell like face cheeks, your stupid candles smell heinous, and you can't even kiss Finn without totes freakin' out!" Aaah! Not my beard. Ohh! Pbht! Ow! Aaah!

Lava all around us!  Lava on the floor! Shut up, man. Seriously, man, there must be an enchantment on the house or something! l'm not playing your child-style games, guy. Watch and learn as l master Reallty. Noooooo!  Aaaaaaaaah!  Jake, what the hay-hay?! l was just playing around with my imagination, and then everything got intense. lt's like Whatever you imagine becomes real. That's bananas! Don't imagine blowing apart my own brain! Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs! Dude, imagine that Beemo invented a better video game and that he has new batteries. BOTH: Whoa! But first, stop imagining Lava!  l can't! My imagination's too amazing! lmagine turning your imagination off. l can't, dude. But l think l can imagine an imagination-turning-off machine that is upstairs, surrounded by a crudload of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains and -- and girls! Cute girls and hamsters! Can't you make it easier to get to that machine? You can't hold this baby back. That's bad parenting, Mama! Then it's up to me to take your imagination downtown! Let's go to the den and suit up! Neat! Grab that missile. Okay. And get that Cosmic Gauntlet. Nah. There's a better one over by the desk.  Unh! Ow. What did l just hit? l'm imagining a wall. You can just go around it. Really?

To cross this bridge, you must first pass the test of the riddle. An imaginary Riddle Master? Ask me your riddle, Riddle Master! l accept your test! RlDDLE MASTER: Then brace yourself, fool, for this riddle comes from a mysterious, faraway land. Lay it on me! Yes, um The riddle -- uh, it cometh, uh l-l can't imagine a riddle.

Let's just get to your imaginary machine, and we'll be okay! Aah, a big bowl of baby elephants, chain saws, and doo-doo is flying towards us! Jump, dude!  Here comes a soul eater! Snap its neck! Ow! The Bazooka Goblin has you in its sights! Hey, don't shoot us with that bazooka!  Don't you do it!  Don't do it, man! GOBLlN: Heh heh-heh heh. Okay. Oh, yeah!

Yeah. l mean, there's a bunch of cute girls, but they shouldn't bother you. Yah! Uh, where Where is this? l can't Aw, man. Oh, l found the shut-off lever! Cool, man!  Dang, girl, if you weren't a figment of my imagination, l'd want to have your baby.  What are you laughing at? All right, l'm gonna turn it off.  - Unh! You said it was clear of danger!

Get to the lever! Okay. Aah! l'm doing it! Aw, yeah! The imaginary poison is gone, Jake! Jake?  Hey, come on. Wake up, man. Hello, Finn. l am awake and healthy. Jake, what happened to your bombastic personality? l do not know what you mean. l am perfectly bombastic. Nah, man, nah. Something's wrong. Tell me something amazing. But, Finn, l cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that l can describe for you. Aw, see, man? You suck now! Crap. lt's your imagination. You need that thing. Jake, stop it, man. You're just playing one continuous note. One note is all that is needed.  l'm gonna turn your imagination back on. Uhwhere Jake, your imagination on/off switch has vanished! True. Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination? l remembereth. l am happy that my imagination is gone. lt was purposeless. No, it was the opposite of that stuff. l know this now, only too late. Okay, man, l'm gonna try to imagine an imagination-back-on switch for you. And so you know, if there's anything dainty inside my imagination, l'm gonna be mad! lmagination go! What the stuff? Well This isn't so bad. Nothing lame, at least. Hey, and there's Jake's imagination switch!  Welcome to your lmagination Land l am your imagination band  Cram! Oh, maybe l can try imagining something. Hmm!  lmagination cans lmagination cans We can shake our imagination cans  Oh!  Now for that switch.  Good morrow, Sir. My name is Bellamy Bug. Would you care for a crocheted doily my daughter made? She imbued it with her tears. You see, she recently broke up with a gentle dandy. No! How'd you get in my lmagination Land?!  l don't know, my young fellow. You tell me. Perhaps l represent your secret desire to be civilized. Represent this!  And this!  Oh, l say! Oh! Oh! Ow! Ouch! Oh! Ow! Penguins.  All right. l hope this works, Jake. Yeah!  Huh?

  Fearlessly, Captain Root Beer Guy charges across the battlefield. The ancient sleeper raises his power staff to attack. With one lever pull, Captain Root Beer Guy saves the Root Beer Guy! One day at a time. Okay, Loafy, just a second. Hmm? Hello? Root Beer Guy? Nope. Starchy. You do this every morning. I know. I'm sorry, honey. I'm trying, but I can't stop thinking about him. Look, we've been married two months already. I love you, baby, but isn't there an expiration date to this grieving thing? I don't think it works that way. Starchy, dear, could you feed the cat later? I've got to prep a witness tonight. Anything for my Cherry Cream Soda and her sweet, little kitty cat. Oh! I'll win your heart someday, Loafy. We can't all be a cute, little character with a cute, little straw sticking out of our cute, little head. But take some advice from an old grave digger, huh? Maybe it's time to do something with that. Here's a thought I could bury this for you. An unmarked grave kind of thing. Just sswt! Toss him in there with whoever. Well, that's that seems macabre. But sweet. I'll think about it. Okay, okay. See you tonight. Looks like it's gonna rain. Don't forget your umbrella, Starchy. Ooh, thanks. Maybe I'll take my hoe in case things get sloppy. Well, bye again. Bye. You two are married. Goodbye, Root Beer Guy. Good morning, husband. Good morning, wife. Shaving your 'stache? Uh-huh. Aaaaahhhh! Starchy! What? What? Blazes mazes! What is going on? I saw him. He was right outside. Who? Finn? Jake? Candy person number 22? Maybe I can still catch him Hi, sweetie. I was dead, but I came back to life. That was really something. Hmm. It's okay, baby. Starchy's here. Oh, thank heavens. It was just another hallucina-a-tion. Honey, I'm fairly upset that you remarried. But how is this possible? You were zapped by Darren, the ancient sleeper. Your dome was cracked. Your root beer soaked into the ground. I buried your remains in a mason jar, which is now your head. And and and now I'm with Starchy. I mean, we're we're legally married. You're legally dead. Not that I want to sound obsessed with legalities, but I am a lawyer. Hey, where's that little statue I got you? It said, "I wuv you," on the base of it. It was a little bear with his arms out like this. He was all, "I wuv you, I wuv you, I wuv you." No sudden moves, baby. He's got freaky zombie strength. Maybe it's up here. Did you hire a maid service or something while I was gone? I sure hope they didn't throw out the "I wuv you" bear. Enough! I should have put you in the ground a long time ago! Hey, I came back for her. Root Beer Guy, if that is you in there, I'm so proud of you. But this isn't fair. You ended our life together when you pulled that lever. You made the choice, and you saved the kingdom. But you lost me. Heh. Burn. Cherry Cream Soda, I still wuv you whoa! You always wanted this wall knocked down anyway, right? Ooh. Oooh! Wah! You come back with no explanation, wreck up the place, and you expect to just pick up where we left off? Get out of my house! I'm sorry. Starchy wins! That's funny. I can't believe you used to be married to such a freak. He isn't a freak. Or he didn't used to be. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Don't worry, honey. Don't touch me now, please. I need time to think. Look, baby. Starchy knows all the fresh widows in town, and Starchy chose you. Starchy wuvs you. It's time to dig a hole. I thought she'd be happy to see me, but it was disaster. I didn't know where to pick up with her, so of course I just acted like a goof. Oh, and now I'm one of the undead, I guess. Hey, man, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you. She's got a point, though. I was the one who wanted to be the big hero, and I got my wish. But I didn't think about her enough. I'm not even thinking about her right now. - Yes, you are. - I am? Run back and tell her all the stuff you've been telling us. Maybe you could pick up from a place you Haven't been yet. I don't know what that means, but it sounds very encouraging! See you guys later. He didn't bite you, did he? Cherry Cream Soda! Cherry Cream Soda! I've had a revelation of some kind. No dirt-heads allowed. Uh, but I have to talk to Cherry Cream Soda. Oh, no you don't. Nuh-uh. I'm trying to be polite. Oh, dear. Hmm. Pardon me! It's on, zombie. What the heck? You have met your match, freaky dirt guy! Woo-woo-woo-woo! Look, will you give me a break? Too chicken, huh? Look, I'll put the shovels down. See? Hah! This is childish. Ha! Get away from my head! Ho-ho! We have some unfinished business. Wait for me, Little Dirt Beer! Ooh, is somebody afraid of old Starchy? I'm afraid of killing you. Oh, boo-hoo. Don't hurt me! Ugh. Is it not possible to get away from you? I'm escorting you to your new home Far away from my house. It's not even your house. Ha! It's practically mine. Tonight, you'll sleep in a hole The same dirty grave hole from whence you sprang! I'm not usually violent, but you pushed me. Nah. What's this? Okay, now we're talking. Poke me with a shovel now, you mustache face. Aw. Stop it, both of you. Neither of you thought to ask me what I want. I've made a decision who I want to be with. I don't want to be with either of you. - What?! - You're a maniac. I can't believe I ever got that low. Hmm! Starchy doesn't need this. And you. I don't know you anymore. Okay. Take care of yourself. I said "I don't know you," but I'd like to. Would you like to go on a date? Yee! I mean, yes. This is weird, right? Well, we've never actually dated before. We got married so fast. Let's take it slow this time around. One date at a time.


1 (MOUSE SQUEAKS)  (PENGUINS CHIRP)  (ALL CHEERING)  (SCREECHES)  (QUACKS)  Adventure Time Come on, grab your friends We'll go to very distant lands With Cake the cat and Fionna the human The fun will never end It's Adventure Time  Get back here, you worm!  What?! The last chapter of "Cosmic Kissing"?  My stirring lyrical interlude  from "Fionna Goes to the Market"?  The epilogue from "Flame Prince Breaks a Sweat"?!  (GASPS)  Who gave you permission to edit my fan fiction?!  Prepare to be punished!  But first  what'd ya think?  Wenk!  Great critique!  (ZAP!)  Wenk.  I don't need an editor.

(CLEARS THROAT)  "Sunlight gleamed through the window  as Fionna sat patiently at the breakfast table."  (HUMMING)  Hah!  Check out my sweet flippin' moves.  You're a real ace in the kitchen.  Roar! Ha ha!  Cooking is fun!  Here come the flapjacks!  Know what's better than cooking?  No! Wha?!  These are narrative flapjacks.  Darlin', don't you see the brilliant comedy laid out before you?  You wouldn't eat Act II before Act I, silly.  Now try starting with the dockworker having a moral crisis.  Okay.  This one?  Fionna, this character doesn't serve any thematic purpose  until much later in the meal.  Sorry, Cake, but these just look like  formless blobs of sweet flapjack to me.  Mmm  It's true.  Maybe if I based them off real people,  do some "life cooking"  Nonfiction flapjacks!  Let's go griddle up portraits of the entire kingdom!  Got to get my supplies together.  My portable griddle  Mmm.  Some peppermint eggs  and the twice-cursed flour!  Got it!  Ready for stories and flapjacks?  Heck yes!  You're wasting me on breakfast!  FIONNA AND CAKE: No one asked you, Flour Demon.  That was like a cookbook  written by a genius.  On to the next chapter  "A Game of Gumball."  Prince Gumball would probs make a great flapjack model.  Sometimes he gets so absorbed in his work  that he doesn't move for days.  Ooooh!  I can break out the pink sea salt and  Hey, there's Gumball!  (PAPERS RUSTLING) Uh  GUMBALL: Is it here?  No. No.  Ah! Just what I need!  The periodic table of candy elements!  If I use this one and this one here  Ha ha! The perfect strategy!  Hyup!  (INHALES SHARPLY)  Butterscotch Butler, the butterscotch Scottish butler,  I challenge you!  (SIGHS) (SCOTTISH ACCENT) Again?  I've gathered all the necessary strategy and tactics  to finally defeat you!  To play, one must know strategy, yes.  But to know victory, one must also know their opponent!  Opponent?  Their dreams  their ambitions  their rrrregrets  (HISSES)  and their fears!  M-My mortality!  (POP!)  Byeeee!  King me.  (GROWLS)  (BOTH GASP) (GLASS SHATTERS)  Maybe we should find someone a little more relaxed.  How?! How did you know?!  Huh?  Oh. You leave that lying around everywhere.  (SCOFFS)  Yes!  (SIZZLING)  Still not quite right.  How about this for some inspiration?  (HISSES)  Pancakes and flapjacks are nothing alike!  (GROANS)  Aw, Cake.  It's just that flapjack literature is such a niche genre,  and none of my flapjacks are turning out any good.  Come on, Cake.  We've still got 10 minutes before the library closes.  It's Flame Prince!  What's that fire hazard doing in the library?  Hmm?  Oh, no!  Oh! I love that author!  Have you read her newest book?  I-I could, uh, find it for you.  Oh. Uh, n-nah, that's okay.  I'll just start with this one.  Thanks, though.  Uh Aah!  Oh. Sorry about that.  Uh Uh W-w-w W-w-w Eh  No, no, no, no, no! Hot, hot, hot!  Wow. I am not graceful today.  N-Not the first editions!  Ow, ow!  Ow, ow, ow!  Easy  Unh!  (FOOSH!)  Gah! Huh?!  Leaving, yes?  Yeah. I'll borrow this one, please.  Of course! I'll just need you to sign it out.  (SIZZLING)  (BOTH SCREAM)  (SIGHS)  I'm sorry.  I have a duty to serve the library's patrons,  but I'm also sworn to protect the books.  I can't in good conscience let you take it home.  But maybe I could read this book to you?  Listen, I just came in here to use the bathroom, man.  I thought you had to, like, check out a book first to pee.  Actually, I don't even have a library card.  (LAUGHING)  (BOTH LAUGHING)  (WHOOSH!)  (PANTING)  Lumpy Space Prince!  (COUGHING)  (GASPS)  (GROANS)  Lumpy Spaaaace Priiiince!  (COUGHS SOFTLY)  Come on. You've been coughing for five days.  Just take one tablespoon.  Uh B-Bumpy Space Prince?  Uh, there's no one here by that name.  Then who am I talking to?  Uh, this is Ja Jack.  (COUGHS) Huh.  Well, if you're Jack, then I'mmmm  MMMMichael Dean.  Yeah. And I'm looking for this beautiful prince.  I got to give him this magic potion!  See, he was cursed by this evil snot gnoll.  Really?  The snot gnoll transformed him  into a totally disgusting mucus monster.  What?! No, I'm not!  (GASPS) Did you hear that?  Huh? What is it?!  It's It's  (ROARS)  It's the snot gnoll!  (GROWLING)  Aah!  Uh-oh! It's coming towards your tree, Jack!  (GRUNTS) I'm stuck!  I'll protect you, beautiful prince!  (HEAVY FOOTSTEPS)  Step off, snot gnoll!  (CRASH!)  Get him, Michael Dean!  (CRASH!) Gah! It got me!  Ugh!  No!!  (THUMP!) (GRUNTS)  I got one last hit in!  (HEAVY FOOTSTEPS) I-It's running away!  (FOOTSTEPS SOFTEN, FADE)  (SIGHS, COUGHS)  I think this is the end for me.  Rally, Michael Dean!  (GRUNTS)  (POP!)  (VOICE BREAKING) It's too late for me, beautiful prince.  Take the potion.  (VOICE BREAKING) Take it and live.  Live!  (GROANS)  I won't let your sacrifice be wasted.  (GLUG! GLUG!)  (GLASS SHATTERS)  See? No more coughing.  Hey, yeah. Actually, I do feel better.  (POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP!)  Wow.  Maybe that was the wrong potion.  Much better!  ICE QUEEN: Lounged atop their comfortable sense of ennui,  Flynn the human being and Jacques the raccoon  listened to the Ice President read his fiction.  "Lynn the person looked at Janet and asked, 'Am I my feelings?  Do I exist because I can't stop feeling?'  Janet the fox answered her.  'Feelings are action,  and like all mortal action, they are doomed to failure.'"  Flynn and Jacques sighed.  They totally got it.  The end!  What do you guys think? Too philosophical?  (FLUTE PLAYS) (PENGUINS CHANTING "WENK!")  (GROANS)  Out of my way!  Blazin' blueberries Comin' through!  (PENGUINS CHANTING "WENK!")  You're ruining my literary reading!  Oh, hey, Ice Queen.  Do you want Cake to make your flapjack portrait?  Why, ye No! I mean no!  Why don't we table this for now, so I can  destroy you!  Hang on to your turkeys,  because I'm about to make the toughest flapjack ever.  Some purple chicken milk  dramatic cornmeal  Nooooo!  And the tears of this reflective turtle.  (WHISPERING) You will outlive everyone you love.  (NORMAL VOICE) Cry for me, little mama!  (SIZZLING)  Here, Fionna!  (SHING!)  Tasty!  Hey, Ice Queen, I really liked your story.  The imagery was tight.  Can you believe it was my first draft?!  No way!  Gotcha!  I call it "Portrait of an Author."  (CHUCKLES)  I really did like her story, though.  I wonder how that Ice President got elected.  Talk about life imitating art.  Gunter, did you see what Daddy did?  Did you guess the secret theme?  Wenk!  No! You're way off!  Fionna and Cake were at the breakfast table.  Gumball consulted the periodic table.  Flame Prince set fire to the table of contents.  The purple thing had a tablespoon of syrup.  And Ice Queen did a tabley thing, too, probably.  Wenk!  They're not like regular stories.  They're shorter.  I'll call them grabl  No tables!  Wenk.  (SLURPS)  I'll never look at tables the same way again.


    What's wrong with you, man? I ate all the candy in your backpack, and now I'm sick. I didn't bring any candy. Oh, no. That explains why it didn't taste right. Nothing tastes right today. Like, I thought we were gonna get into some serious flavor with these sand people, but they're just standing around like garnish. That's how I feel, like a dying parsley. So, what's going on with the spoon? Marceline and the spoon. Um nothing. Wait, there she goes. MARCELINE: Yo, wake up, sand dude. I think they're dead. A spoon. - Yeah, yeah! The spoon of prosperity! It doesn't look like mu  Oh, my gosh! I feel so much better Hungry, even. Guys, let's go home. We got to get this spoon to Princess Bubblegum first.  Let's rock!  MARCELINE: What's PB want with that spoon, anyway? FINN: Beats me. JAKE: Sometimes it's better not to know. Yeah, I guess that's true with Bonnibel. Hey, guys. Look what I found? Is that quicksand? Yeah. Ugh!  Quicksand is pretty fun.  Quit messing around, Jake. Okeydoke.  Hmm. Hey, is this whole place made out of sand? Sure looks that way. Uh give me a pull, please. Stop! You guys are tickling me! Let me try this other thing. Flesh drill! I'm not sure that's a good idea. Yaah! Rug burn! Ow! Ow! Aah! Whoo! It worked! Jake drill worked, you guys. Whoa! Check it out. My piggies are free. You just demolished half the underground city. Yeah, only half. You also sealed our exit. Our only exit. Ugh! No regrets! I'm sorry. This little piggy stayed home, and so should have I. I know! I'll dig us out of here. BOTH: No! - You'll bury us alive! - Undead! Finn to PB. Come in, PB. Oh, hi, Finn. Princess, we're trapped in the underground city. Yeah, yeah. That sounds great. Huh?! No, we need help! That's great! Grea grea great!  I guess we lost the signal. Any other bright ideas? Snacks! How are snacks gonna get us out of here? I want to eat snacks because I am hungry. I'm hungry, too. Bust the snacks, Finn. Bust, bust, bust! Hey, where are my red erasers? They were in here. Uh-oh. I thought they were candy. You ate all my red?! - Ooh. I'm sorry! - Calm down, Marceline. There's got to be some red stuff in these ruins. I'll go explore. You guys hang out here and save your energy. Thanks, Finn. Be cool. So how hungry are you?  Aah! I'm sorry! Please don't eat my blood!  Jake, I don't want to hurt you, but you should know things get crazy when I'm hungry. Like, how crazy? I'm gonna go into feral mode. Oh, it's not gonna be pretty.  I know. Let's tie me up. That way you won't be scared. And that will keep you from draining my bloods? Not physically, no, but as a prop, I think it'll be good for both of us. You know, psychologically.  Hurry, Finn. Red, red, red. I guess even a vampire queen's face would melt off if she tried to eat lava. Get me a bucket of lava, Jake. Yo, you know better than that. Do it. Don't go crazy, okay? I'm freaking hungry.  Why did you leave me here, dude?  Okay. Here we go. Yeah, look at that! Something crazy red behind this door. Hmm. Why are y'all holding this door shut? You don't look like sand peeps, neither. More like wise menzards. Oh, well. Got to feed the Marcy monster. Scuse me! Uh! Sorry! Okay. Uh hyah! Whoa!  Oh, dag. Cool. What the heck happened here? Whoop. Ew. Oops. Y'alls got turned into sand people. Don't go in the light. Go like this, around it. Next time, you guys. Hmm. Whatever's down there has got to have red blasting out of every hole. Hey, you're not still alive, right? Okay. I was just making sure. Bet that guy was a creep. This hole is deep. Oh, my glob. Oh, my glob. Where are you, man? Marcy's wigging out. - Jake. - What? I can smell your insides, Jake.  They smell  red! Aah! Yeah, let me see in there. Aah! Oh, yeah. Aah! Maybe I should go back. Well, I've already gone this far. Shebang. That ought to be enough red to un oops. Paris? Is that you? You mean the guy with the big thing on his head? Yes! Have you returned to complete the plan? Nah. Paris is, like, super-dead. What? No! How long? Dude, like, a really long time. Like 500 years. I must have zoned out. What the heck were you two doing? Once we turned the city to sand, we were gonna reanimate their bodies and conquer my homeland at the center of the planet. Mm. That's dumb. Time to go back home a true loser. Can I have this big old ruby then? That's an emerald. Clearly it's a big old ruby. I don't know what to tell you, man. - I would like the ruby. - It's yours, buddy. Hmph! Huh! Ah, I'm outies. Peace. Whoops. JAKE: Okay. All done now. Nice and snug, right? -  Jake. - What? I won't be able to to control myself much longer. I can feel the feeding frenzy coming on. I just want to let you know I'm sorry.  You're sick! Yeah.  Come on, Jake. Think.  It's no good! I need brain food. Oh, dang. I ate everything. Ohh! I'm so hungry! Baby's gonna starve to death! Unless What?  Mmm. What are you doing? I'm cooking up a crazy vampire. That should heat up nice. Sand will keep the meat moist. You're gonna eat me? You's gonna eat me! Yes, I am. Cook, baby, cook! FINN:  Finn! The trick is rolling it. Phew! Check out this ruby I got. That's an emerald, dude. You too now?! Emeralds are green, boy. This thing is green. Why is everybody messing with me? It's like a dark-grayish-red, mostly gray. Sometimes red things are gray! You're a little color-blind. And there's nothing to be ashamed of. Oh. Whoops. I'm sorry you had to push that thing so far. Uh, what's going on with Marcy? She was trying to eat my insides, so I'm cooking her. I know that sounds crazy, but I had no choice. I'm operating on my lowest survival brain function right now. What? Aah! - Chill, man! - No, we got to book! Go! - MARC Y: Go where, Jake?  I got to suck out your insides first, right? Ah, nay-nay, bro! Time to eat.  Huh? What the FINN: Bubblegum? Hey, guys. I saw my seismograph had gone off the charts, so I figured you might be in trouble, right? Yeah, but watch out for Marceline. She's gone rabid. What? Marceline's gonna rap for me? Aah! Woof. Thanks, Bonnie. That's enough low-grade red to get me home, at least. Come on, guys. Let's go. Are you all right, PB? Did you get the spoon of prosperity? Yeah. Here you go. ALL: Whoa! Peeps will never starve in my eternal empire. Sand worm, up!    


     Whoo-hoo!  Next. Oh, your highness, can you help my poor child? His hair is starting to go, and we can't afford flame care and  Take this fortifier. It should last you through the cold season. Oh, glob bless thy soul! More tea, your highness?  Thank you. Mm-hmm. Who's next? Hi, um, my microwave seems to be broken and --  Aah!  Flame princess! Don John -- the flame lord! I fear you're not evil enough to rule the kingdom. Excuse me? How dare you! What? You've been poisoning me. How could you, Ursula? Guards!  Huh? Oh, here he comes! No!  Yes! Playtime's over, honey. Time to give daddy his throne back. I've secretly arranged to make don John my vizier and give him my daughter's hand in marriage. Uh, yeah, I know. Ha-ha!  Hwah! Man, you're looking shredded. My gym is dark magic, and my protein shake is rage. Okay, okay.   Splendid work, don John. No big "d," bro. Heavens to Betsy!  Cinnamon bun! Don't let them escape! Come here, girl. We're getting hitched!  No!  Go away!  I can't leave. I have to fight for my kingdom. No. Fight later. Now we get help. Huh? Aah! Hwah! Why did I jump? Thanks, c.B.  You're welcome. How are you feeling? A little better, I think. Who should we go to for help? Princess bubblegum? BOTH: Nah. I don't trust her. Yeah, she's devious. Well, I've seen finn battle huge monsters and even armies, and we need somebody who can fight. C.B., take me to finn. Mm, okay. FINN:  Waah! Finn! FINN: Um  Hey. Uh, Jake isn't here. He's sleeping over at lady rainicorn's, maybe. Finn, I've been slowly poisoned by my treacherous handmaiden. Now my powers are weakened, and -- and the flame lord has freed my father and threatened to marry me. But I escaped with c.B. FINN: Oh, what? I'll help you. I'll do anything for you. Listen, finn, this doesn't mean we're getting back together. We're all business. FINN: Mm-hmh. Of course. Yeah, business.  I'm feeling exhausted. Where can I freshen up? FINN: Girl's bathroom is over there. Also, it's the boy's bathroom. Oh, thanks. FINN: So, what do you think, c.B.? You think I still have a shot with her, right? No. FINN: Does she ever talk about me? Is she seeing anybody? No and no. FINN: "No and no," she does talk about me, or "no and no," she isn't seeing anybody? All right, guys. Let's wolf. FINN: So, your fire wolf can fly. Yep. I taught him. FINN: Hmm.  Whoa! You've cooled down a lot. No funny stuff. FINN: Things have been going great for me lately. Been hanging out with my boys. I got a cursed sword arm now, so that's new. Yeah, I've been exercising a lot and taking some piano lessons -- trying to improve myself. Not dating anybody or anything, just getting a little me time, being the best finn I can be.  Hyup! FINN: Oh, no!  FINN: I hid my flameproof suit behind these rocks Just in case, whatever, you know? So, the guards are posted here and here, so we should probably sneak in here. FINN: Suited! Uh FINN: Remember my fire suit? Hey, c.B., you did a great job getting us here and everything, but I got this, all right? I got a sword arm, so -- yeah, you said that. FINN: Watch this. Hey, guards! Come at me at the same time! What are you doing?! FINN: Let's go, princess! But that wasn't the plan! No! FINN: Ha-ha! It's the princess. Capture them! FINN: Ahhhhh-- no, finn! Don't hurt them! They're entranced! FINN: Oh, right. Oh, no. Captured. Hyah! Um  FINN: There's c.B.! Get that bun! Could you move, please? Whoo, get 'em, boys. We're taking these two away. FINN: Don't worry, f.P., your boy finn won't fail you. Put up your Dukes. You have permission to leave when you out-Duke us. Okay. Duke! Duke! Duke!  Duke! Uh, Duke! These two are out-duked! Now I'm making my escape.  FINN: Trust me. It'll be fine. For soon you shall be mine.  If you've forgotten, I'm reminding you now. Never! FINN: Yeah! It's because you secretly still have feelings for me. No! FINN: Hmm. I can never marry you because I don't even know you, much less like you, and forcing me to marry you is gross. Whoo! Whoo! Man, I love staring out over things. Whoo! It's so good to be king. You said she'd do whatever you told her. Umm, okay But she refuses to marry me. She's her own woman, you liar! Liar? You want to fight me? Aye -- fistfight. Yes, I'll fistfight you. Come on! You hit me? Felt good! Oof! I love fistfighting.  You dirty bread Baker.  Aah!  Put them down. Put your Dukes down! No!  BOTH: Whaa?  BOTH: We're saved! Hi. Got a key. Fight! Fight! They're distracted. Let's go. Yaah!  Leg press!  StaminaFailing.  Come on!  Cheater!  Onward, Jake ii!  Aah! C.B., are you okay?  Huh? What happened? Should -- should we keep attacking? Stop! You were all brainwashed by him! Uh-oh. Hey, I don't like that guy! Yeah, let's get him!  Capture him! It wasn't me. It was don John! Aah! Huh? Oh Aah! Have you all gone dumb from don John's magic? I mean, how do you expect this softy to rule you? She's even weaker than before from being poisoned. Look!  Oh, come on! You're wrong. Flame princess may not be the most ruthless of all despots, but she is strong where it really counts -- in her heart. And that is good. I have learned so much watching this beautiful woman work, and with her example, I have become a better man. I will be by her side as her champion and knight every step of the way because I love her. Thank you.  Aww, how sweet! FINN: Geez. Did I just get shown up by cinnamon bun? Have you obtained the staff of stranson doughblow? Yes, Bella noche. We procured the staff using the full extent of our wizardy ways. Then the time has come to reveal my true form, and when I materialize on this ICE KING: Oh, this striz is going down, man. you will receive your end of the deal. The lost system of antediluvian magick -- the tightest of all wiz biz. So right and tight I get restless leg syndrome about it. Look! And now it will be yours. ICE KING: And mine! What the blood?! Ice king! ICE KING: Listen, dudes, all I want is to be in the club and plus up my magic. What's the problem? Your life is my problem. Too late, fools! Bella noche emerges.  Whoa! What the Stop that now, trash cones. Bella noche must not cross into our world. ICE KING: Uh, why not again? Duck! Aaaah! ICE KING: Aaaah! Aaaaah! Ah, cram! Here we go! Uh, hey. Hey, I can't feel my magic! Me neither. What gives? Bella noche is a being of pure anti-magic! Y'alls got played! Uh, hello? Oh, what a fool am I! Aaaaaah! Go! Destroy! Throw your boots at it, or -- I don't know! Huh?  Dang. Sorry, ice king. This must be it, man. I've crossed into some new super-insane zone where I feel like I'm just normal again. Or maybe I'm just normal again. Hey, stop looking at yourself. You're ugly, bro. Get lost. This is my busking spot.  Sorry, man. No time! Go, carpet! Whoa! It's got to be here. Even in my prolonged state of insanity, my immutable essence must have known to -- oh, yes. Hello. Ah, my research. My Jackie -- jacket! Mutation, mutation, mind expa-- aha! "Mystic rituals and their space-time applications" by Simon petrikov and Betty grof. Betty. Whoops. Marceline? A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four. FINN: Wait! What? FINN: Why are you holding your bass up high like that? Unh-unh. I get better finger action this way. FINN: But you look like a nerd. Move it back down. It's better. JAKE: Move the bass down. FINN: A-move the bass a-down. JAKE: Be reasonable. Yes? Marcy, it's me, Simon. I'm back, but my body might donk out soon. So, get to the ice kingdom fast and help me with this time portal so I can find Betty and say I'm sorry before I croakboat! I know that's a lot to process, but hurry, and bring hambo. Hambo is the key. Okay, Marcy? You got that? Marcy? A long, long time ago, Simon was my only friend. He was there when I needed help. All he ever wanted was to find Betty, and now I can help him.  Simon? Wenk! Wenk! Simon! Marceline! I thought I'd never see you again. I can hardly believe it myself. You're all grown up. JAKE: Believe! She's like a million years old. One million years? How could it be?! He's just kidding. I'm only a thousand. JAKE: And still looking good! FINN: Do you remember anything from when you were the ice king? Nothing specific -- just dreamlike impressions. FINN: Do you still have impressions from all the times we flipped your bricks? I haveBruises.  Excuse me.  Man, Simon. I'm fine. You're dying! Well, yes, but only in increments. I've still got work to do. Finn and Jake, will you run my generator? FINN: Yeah, man. JAKE: Cool.  That's great! Keep pedaling! All we need now is the catalyst -- an object from the past that has been lovingly tended to through the ages.  Goodbye, hambo.  Because of you, I can say goodbye to Betty and tell her I'm sorry for driving her away. Thank you, marceline.   ICE KING: Where's my Betty? Where's my princess?! Princess! Princess!! Simon, don't leave me like this. Betty? Betty. Betty! Simon? What is going on? I'm a thousand years in the future, love. I opened this portal so we could say goodbye. You're dumping me? No! It's just that everything changed after I put on that crown. I-I went crazy, you ran away, I-I never saw you again. But where would I go without you? I'll never know. I don't understand. You don't seem crazy now. I mean, in the future. The portal is closing. There's no time to explain. Just know that I love you and I forgive you for leaving me. Simon, I know who I'm leaving you for! Who?! You, dum-dum!  Hmm? Simon? What's wrong? Are you sick? No, I'm old. The crown was keeping me alive, but it's magic was negated by the creature Bella noche. Don't die, Simon. I just got here. Oh, I'm sorry, Betty. I know! I'll fix the crown, and then I'll figure out how to fix you! What? No. Guys, stop her. JAKE: Uh Hmm. FINN: Yeah, but JAKE: It kind of sounds like a good idea. Right, whoever you are. I'm sorry. It's the only way. No! Okay, rug, take me to Bella noche. Get on, Simon! I am getting on The death bus. I got you in my sights, Simon.  It's my time, Betty! I don't want to be the ice king again. It's like living with eternal diaper butt. I can't do it! Not forever. Destroying Bella noche and getting your power back will buy me time to find a loophole that'll undo your curse and your death. I can do it! You got to believe me, Simon! I Get real, man. You're gonna be the ice king till the sun blows up. This is your one chance. I made a mix tape for the ride -- "summer jams 3"! If I don't let her try, then what am I? What am us? What? Uh, fair enough. See you in a few.  This brioche won't stop growing. Ron James, what tookYou? Yo, my lab got creamed! I had to dummy-rig an alchemical filter out of a dirty bidet and a vaporizer! But will the double-negative magic work? Heck yeah! Ron James always delivers! Check it out, brotha! Yaah! In your face!  BOTH: Yeah! What the stink is that?! My lab conditions were not ideal. But you did not deliver. Peace, man! Aaaah!  We're here to help! Help? How? We're toast, bro.  Simon!  Hey, don't scare me like that. Just hold my hand to your face. This will be myLast sensation. Don't be a wimp, Simon! Just give me a second! You got about 15 seconds. How the wait. Surprise! Tranch! ALL: Ohhhhh! You lose, Simon. Sorry, man. ICE KING: Uh, huh?  This a party? Huh? Wizard city is saved!  ICE KING: Whoa!  Okay. Whoopee! So, then, Ron James told me this girl I was with flew into Bella noche and mysteriously defeated it for me! Wow!  Just my luck, right? Black out for a day and meet the woman of your dreams. I will get you! ICE KING: Hey, don't be jealous, muscle princess. She's gone -- kablooie. Let's be realistic, right? We both know you're not my top pick. Oh, grod!  ICE KING: No! Aaah! Go home! You can go! Aah!  


  Whoaaa! That was awesome! Let's go over there! Wheee! Come on! Come on! Wow! Yay! Wheee! Whoaaa! Hmm. Why would I need to know about Caterpillar families? I don't get it. Well, they look like they're having fun. Real leaves aren't made out of candy. They always have a gross, bitter taste. - Terry eats all the Caterpillars! - Mmm! Ah, it's so good! Ugh! That's gross, too. There's no way real Caterpillars are delicious. You think? I bet they taste great if you're a bird. The Caterpillar eats the leaf. Then the bird eats the Caterpillar. Then the big bird eats the little bird. The big bird then dies, and its remains decompose into rich, fertile soil. And from that soil, a new plant bursts to life. And then the Caterpillar eats the plant again. And so the circle of life continues. This is the law of nature we call the food chain. Isn't that fascinating? Yo, Princess Bubblegum, do birds play football? - No, Terry. They don't. - That's weak, ma'am. You guys, this is lame. No way I'm eating a bug's butt. Those kids are right. What's the big deez about the food chain, anyway? Let's hit the snack bar and eat something yummy. - Hey, this is pretty fun! - Hey, have you noticed we are birds now? - I'm hungies. - Look over there! That oasis looks pretty good to me. Bon appetit! - Oh, dude, you ate those?! - Come on, man! We're sweet, sweet birds, and we get to eat worms. This is a unique experience. Uh, how did I get so mad chubs? - I only ate one grub. - Dude, you've been eating grubs for hours. - What?! - Yeah. You're a beast. Help me, Jake! My body's too bloated to fly! Hide! Ugh, there goes my din-din. Why am I hungry again? - Jake! - Who are you? - It's me, Finn. Dang, when did you get so big? And old? You feeling okay, bro? Jake, we are good friends. So let me just say you look awesome right now. - Ha, really? - Yeah. You're looking tasty. Hey, why don't you take a seat in my mouth? - Why? That's Weird. - It's okay. It's okay. Just give it a try. - It's a new experience, right? - Wow, you have a lot of saliva. You must have a broken pipe, old timer. - It's comfy, though. - Whoa! - Did you just try and eat me?! - No? But if I did, that'd be okay, right? You are trying to eat me! - I'm just following the law of nature. - What're you talking about? I don't know. I just feel that way. Aw, Jake, you're missing out By not getting eaten By me. Uh-oh! Sorry, man! I'm not into it. So alone. So hungry. The law of nature Has claimed this bod. Yay! What a big turnout. Top notch! - To decompose stuff! - Yeah! We are so pumped! - Yeah! - What's that smell? - Wow! It looks amazing! - Yay! Yay! - Party time! So good! - Awesome. - This bird went bad so well! - You took it too far, man. I'm a dog, and I eat all kinds of horrible things. This is disgusting. Think of it as a conversation starter Like, "the other night, I ate the grossest thing I've ever tasted." you know, it's interesting. Whew! I'm full. - What's going on?! - Whoa!  To a plant A day is short Help! Hey, birds! You are my hero  I think we're safe now - And also Caterpillars. - We're still in a bind, man. - No food, no water. - I'm hungry. - I'm thirsty. - Hey, look! - It's another Caterpillar. Huh? You okay? - She's beautiful. She's just a Caterpillar, dude. Looks like she's gonna faint. You see? Huh. "Love is blind" That must apply to all species. Oh, I see! Your name is Erin, and there's a Famine in your town, so that's why you're out here searching for an oasis. Yes, I have to hurry and find food. Otherwise, my family won't survive. But I don't know if I can go on. Hold on, Erin. Food! Water! Shade! - Where are you?! - Over there The oasis! - Yummy! - Really? You like leaves now? So good, dude! - Your eyes. - Hey, hey, hey! Move over a bit. I got a rhythm going, here. - I've never been this happy. - This oasis is pretty romantic, huh? - Sure, I guess. - So, how many kids you want to have? Uh do you want to get married? - Yes! - And will you, Finn, take this Caterpillar to be your wife, even if she becomes a flower or a bird or a bacteria to love and to cherish till death do you part? - Y-y-yes. - You may now kiss the bride. - This way, Erin! - Hey, is that my butt? Man, it's been a while! - Finn! - When we're reborn as Caterpillars, I'll marry you all over again! That's beautiful, Finn! But when we're bacteria, I might see other people! Hey, why are you eating Caterpillars? - My eyes are open. - The Caterpillar eats the leaf. Then the bird eats the Caterpillar. Then the big bird eats the little bird. The big bird then dies, and its remains decompose into rich, fertile soil. And from that soil, a new plant bursts to life. And then the Caterpillar eats the plant again. And so the circle of life continues.  Round and round as the nature flows It's like one big ring Caterpillars eat plants Small birds eat Caterpillars, big birds eat small birds, bacteria eats the dead big bird from there, plants grow again, Caterpillar eats the plant How natural, no waste, it is an endless chain What an amazing, wonderful, and excellent how harsh, not careless, it's an endless chain What an amazing, wonderful, and excellent food Food chain!  - Eh, so what? Let's go play! - Yeah, weirdo. - I wanna play sports. - Come on! Let's go!


1   Hey, how's it going up there?  Have you made visual confirmation with Glob?  Shut You  This is freaking har  Come again? You're breaking up.  Make sure you tell Glob it's me who sent you.

It's Normal Man now.  Yes.  Powerless.  Normal Man.  Bring him here, Tiny!  No.  Wha Wh Huh?  What is this?  It's a classic double-cross, bozo!  Brother, tell this animal to put me back in space.  You messed with me for years!  Now it's my turn to mess with you!  Hey, Jake.  You need help with demma Eggs Benedict  inna demma hollandaise sauce?  Get over here, dude.  Yo. No dogs on the table.  Shoo! Get down, boy!  Whatcha see, boy? Show Daddy.  I do see something but you're making it weird.  Sorry, bro. What's going on?  Look.  Whoa.  Hey, you! Scram!  Yeah, beat it, Magic Man!  Oh, hey.  Got him!  Uh, is he dead?  Nah, he's magic.  Dude, he lost his powers, remember?  Oh, right.  Uh-oh.  - Phew! - Phew!  Come on. Let's bring him inside, you murderler.  Aah!  Finn and Jake, I need your help.  Why would we help you, Magic Man?  It's Normal Man, and it's not helping me.  It's helping my brother Glob.  Whaaaaaa?  That's where Tiny Manticore took Glob  To the very top of Wild Trap Mountain.  Come on, fool!  Come on. Get spanked!  Tiny always liked you guys.  That's because we freed him from your sick nightmare house.  Maybe he'll listen to you and not hurt Glob.  This could be my chance to make things right between us,  go back to Mars and run things how we used to,  before I threw everyone under the bus.  Like when you made them all go bald or something?  Magic Man, stop this nonsense immediately.  Aah! Magic Man!  As soon as I break these magic bonds,  you're going straight to Ooo on that bus, you hear me?!  Magic Man!  Have some of these bangers, why don't you?  "Bang!"  What's that?  Oh, no! Aah!  Just a few more laps  and I'll break the jerk world record.  You know what, guys?  I'll just go up there and let Tiny margle me off a cliff.  It'll be good for Glob  to see his trashy brother eat it finally.  What do you think about that?  No. Glob's your brother.  And brothers always care about each other,  even if one of them is a terrible  deuce breakfast like you.  So let's stretch up this thing and talk it out with Tiny.  Wait! It's called Wild Trap Mountain for a reason.  Look.  Normal-size manticores.  Carnivore plants.  Camouflage rock beasts.  Mind-control parasites.  Archer bandits that'll shoot you straight out of the sky.  This one quiet dude nobody messes with.  A dragon ghost.  Red ants.  Weekend survivalists.  Waking dream demons.  That squirrel that hates you, Jake.  Who?  We get it. We got to stealth it up there.  Oh. Ouch, my knees.  Shh!  Hey, Jonah.  Hey, Luke. What's going on today?  Freaking nothing yet.  I know.  I just want to kill and eat someone already.  Phew! Well, we got past those guys.  Easy greasy.  You doing okay, Normal Man?  Easy grea  What?  Aah!  I know that voice!  Aah!  Charge!  Surprise, you're dead!  No! Aaaaah!  Go, go, go, go, go, go!  - Finn? - Parasite!  Aah!  What the heck?  To the top!  Wait!  Aah!  Almost there!  Don't bother that guy.  Wow.  Ouch! Freakin' red ants!  Get off my mountain!  Aah, my dreams! I'm having daymares!  There's the top!  Jake! It's me!  Who?  My eyes! Sorry.  Ahh!  Tiny Manticore!  Please! Don't hurt my brother!  This guy is really freaking me out.  Yes! Hello, Normal Man.  Come and greet the dawning of your grimmest day!  How ironic that you, who once trapped me,  are now about to royally bite it.  You stand at the mercy of my boomerang and flamethrower!  I know I really messed you up,  but Glob has nothing to do with this.  Kill me instead.  I'll let you do it.  Why do you sound so insincere?  That's just my voice.  Normal Man's telling the truth.  Yeah!  Finn and Jake?  I respect you guys a ton,  but I have trained for this vengeance for months!  I must seize this sparkling moment full in grasping hand!  Boomerang!  What's even a boomerang?  Oh, my gosh.  I've been calling them something different my whole life.  I'm sorry, Jake! I'm just doing me right now.  We're still cool, though?  Not no more!  Kick his tiny butt.  Aah!  Gah! I hate this mountain.  Boomerang!  Watch out for when it Oof.  Two boomerangs!  Could it be? My moment approacheth?  Steady hand, steady heart.  Look out, dude.  Whoa! Can I just have this?  Uh-oh.  Hang on like hot snot, Normal Man!  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Let go! We're going to fall.  I'm not very big.  I Uh Okay.  Upon reassessment,  this is actually a great situation for me!  Farewell, Magic Man!  By my hand, I soar free!  Aaaaah!  Boy-yay-moy!  Jake!  What?  I'm coming! I got to save the dude.  Ahh.  Oof!  No planes! Never planes!  Glob, are you okay?  Why did you rescue me?  I wanted to bring you back to Mars.  They need a ruler up there, and I wanted to apologize  for being such a beanshow for hundreds of years.  Whoa. What?  Maybe you really have changed.  Yeah, right!  I'm following to watch you die.  You know what, though, Magic Man?  I've been doing a lot of thinking up in orbit.  I shouldn't have shut you out when you got exiled to Ooo.  In some ways, I, too, was a total beanshow.  I guess neither of us were perfect brothers.  Although you were much, much worse.  So, what now?  Are we straight up just going to die?  I guess so.  Sorry.  So, your profile said you were into music.  That's crazy, so am I!  It's stressing me out  that there's food on a blanket!  I have to go home. This was nice.  You're running away from intimacy!  You don't know you'd get hurt!  Tiny? What are you doing?  I could not go through with my vengeance.  It wouldn't have accomplished anything.  Also, you and your brother are really sweet together.  You're hard to track. But okay!  We'll get down ourselves, guys.  Don't even sweat it!  But, yeah, let's hang out sometime.  I'm getting a phone soon.  Bye!  Ready to go home?  Whoa, dang.  Oh, the people of Mars  are gonna be so glad to see you.  It really feels good to be good, you know?  Maybe that's my new catchphrase.  I don't know. Is that dumb?  It's a good catchphrase. You'll do okay up there.  Ahh! Glob, what are you doing?!  My days of ruling Mars are over, but you got this, man.  All right. Well  Oh, my gob. Where were you?  I was with Normal Man. He's cool now.  Whaaaaa? I don't believe it.  Hey, guys. I'm back.  Magic Man!  - Oh! He came back! - Oh, I can't believe it!  It's okay. Calm down.  Calm down?!  You turned me into a giant starfish!  You turned me into a barrel of flaming garbage!  What horrible trick do you have planned now?  I don't really do tricks anymore.  Hmm.  Okay.  Here's a trick.  It's a hat  but inside it are  brownies!  I want to eat those brownies.  It's a start.


    Boop. That's right, Gunther. Keep it up.  Oh-ho-ho, Gunther, just you wait  All right. Here we Go.  That's a good-lookin' lamp.  Gunther, no! Huh?  Just a sec! Here I come. Life giving Magus! I got your telegraph inviting me to come over and share some wizz blizzes, best bro style! I brought tiny umbrellas! I was kind of surprised you invited me over. I thought Abracadaniel was your best friend. Pfft! Oh, I'm done with that guy. He kept trying to analyze me! Come on! Let me give you the nickel tour. These are my tubs 'n' skins. The "no flab" zone. Here's the office. Oh, hey! And remember when you touched that book and, uh, brought it to life? Yep. Ha ha! Aah! This is his room. Get your pen out! Write in me! Write in me! Fill my pages! Yeee. Mm?  What is that wonderful smell? Oh. That? I'm baking my special pigs in blankets Right here in my darkened kitchen. Now, where is the dang ol' oven mitt? It's got to be around here somewhere. Oh, geez! Look who I'm talking to Mr. Oven Mitts over here! Hey, here's a good idea. You should take off those mitts!  Whoo!  I don't want to accidentally bring anything to life in a stranger's home With my magic hands. Come on, the pigs are burning! It's gonna wreck our Wizz Blizz hangout. Be a bro, bro. Mm Well, if it's about being a bro  There we go, baby. Hey, I just remembered that the oven light is burned out. Be a bro and turn on that lamp Right over there. You mean this one lamp in the middle of the kitchen? Correct. Okay. Yeah, touch it. Oh, whoops! I almost did the thing I didn't want to do. Oh, fart hat! Hmm Life giving Magus, watch out behind you! Yaah! Oh, no! Accidental life! Huh? You used me! You don't want to drink Wizz Blizz at all! Yes, I did use you! But for what? What did I use you for?  Oh, my lamp. My beautiful lamp of so many years! Speak to me Hello? Hello A lady?! Unexpected bonus! Well, one isn't purely defined by their sex or gender. I have yet to find out who I really am. I have freedom, no longer bound by the limits of my cord, freedom to shape my reality and, in turn, be shaped by it.  You talk funny. Like a book. Oh, humor. Humor is the highest form of intelligence. Well, hey, here's something funny.  It sounds like a butt! Hmm. Well, goodbye. I'm not sticking around to be used and thrown away. Aw, Magus, I can never have enough friends. Really? Ha haaaa! Ha ha ha! More friends! Yes. Yes! Finally. Gather 'round and lavish me with affection! Hey, we're alive now. You're alive? Whoa! Me too!  What? Sure, we all feel alive now, but how do we know it's not all, you know, just an illusion? I mean, I can reach out and touch you, but it's all just signals to the brain, easily re-creatable with the right technology. You know what I mean?  Are you okay? What's with these nerds? They aren't into my juice. Maybe they just don't have an appreciation for your type of humor. Maybe you could try and learn about what they're interested in. Read up a little Uh-huh. Ugh. Reading makes my brain all cloudy. I bet you'd have something insightful to say about that, huh? Eh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but no. Listen.  Watch this. Through the simple act of creation Have I become a reflection of my own creator? If I may interject Aristotle once said, "nature abhors a vacuum." Then why do I love doing this so much?  Seriously, someone explain it to me. Excuse me. I have to silently back away now. And I I need a refill. Come along, dear. What, am I boring you guys?! The old man's a snooze, huh? You're not so perfect! Simon, I know you're dealing with a lot of unresolved karma, but that is no reason to lash out. What? What are you talking about? You cry in the night times. We all hear you crying Into baby diapers - It's super-sad, dude. - Oh, come on, guys. Quit clownin'. You keep them in my bottom drawer.  Ugh, it's locked. Whew! Somebody say something about a lock? No! Yeah! Get in here, bro! This is your truth, Simon. Hey, hey, give me those! We know all about your weird stuff, like how you use penguin milk as moisturizer. It helps keep my skin cold and clammy. He needs to hear more devastating truths. One time you had food stuck in your beard for two weeks. Like a whole burrito.  Gunther, old buddy, you got to defend me here! Okay! I get it! I'm a dang ding-dong, okay?!  Excuse me, friends. Ice King? No. Go away. Dummies only in this corner. Look, I get it. We're brilliant furniture, and that's hard to keep up with. Maybe you could fit in by being more of a listener. You could be the cool quiet guy the quiet guy who just listens. You know what I mean? You know what I mean, right? Yeah. See? You get what I mean! Ice King is so smart! Noooo! Stop talking! I don't like this! You book lickers! I made you to be my bros! Weight set, we were gonna smash into PB's room together and show her how ripped you made me! Microwave, we were gonna heat up bologna on white-bread sandwiches! Drawer dresser, you were gonna be my improv coach! Yes And? Yes, and You, lamp! I was the most excited for you to be my friend! But then you had to go and use words like I've never heard before words that confused and upset me! Now I have upsetting words for you! Get out! Get out! I'm kicking all of you out! Not so fast, Ice King. We've been in this place just as long as you. We have just as much right to stay. That's for real. What? Hey. We outnumber Simon. Why don't we just vote him out? Yeah! Oh, dear. I got your vote right here! Yoink!  Hey! I'm open! Hyup!  Don't you see? The crown is just another one of your many hang-ups. You've got to flip the script, man. It can be scary, I know. It's okay if you need to cry into this. N-no. Cry, Simon, cry! Cry, Simon, cry! No, no Cry, Simon, cry! We don't like you, but we're here for you! Noooooooo!  Aha! Simon, you're being obtuse.

After Little Finn dumped her, she started working out.  Looks like she's really into it. This is messed up, dude.

     FINN: Ha ha! Time to protect the sun. JAKE: Ha ha, yeah. He knows how to get things started. Fire pit number 1. Easy-peasy, livin' greasy. You wonder why they even put it there. It's probably a computel gleech.  Now comes some real trouble. It's Bouncy Bee. He's gonna get that sun, man. FINN: Ha ha, please. Bleep. - Ha ha! I had my eyes closed on that one. JAKE: Yeah, that was cool. Oh, oh, you missed a coin, dude. Go back. I ain't in it for the money, man. FINN: I'm in it to crush the enemies of the sun, like this sloppy butt right here. JAKE: Hunny bunny. FINN: I'm like, "Hunny Bunny, don't you ever learn? I've always got the bombuh."  JAKE: Man, you are hot tonight. Think you can do it this time? Can you beat Sleepy Sam?

Beemo, this game is the worst. If we were really inside that game, man, we would crush Sleepy Sam, breezily with my mitts. Oh, no. It's much more dangerous than you think. Whoa, whoa, wait! Beemo, is there a way for us to get in the game for real? Yes, of course, Jake. If I push this button If I push this button, you will both be dangerously transported into my main-brain-game-frame, where it is very dangerous. Oh, man! Oh, Beemo! You got to let us in that game. No. It's a far-too-dangerous incredible adventure for you. That's final. Oh. Okay, Beemo. Well, time for bed. Finn? Time for bed, right, Jake? Oh, right.  Good night, Beemo. JAKE: Time for bed.   Wow! Whoa! Whoa! We're in the game! Look, there's the sunshine we got to protect. And there's the hole we're supposed to go down. And there's you doing whatever you're doing. I'm looking at my bits. My leg is math! Mm, that sunshine feels good. Feels good all over. No wonder all the monsters in this game want to get their grubby mitts on it. Let's go kick their digital bootays! Doot-doot. Doot-doot-doot. Beep-boop.  We are in the computer world We're computer boys, not computer girls In a game, I can be who I virtually am I can walk and sing I can kill Sleepy Sam Hey, what stinks?  Smells like Pit! Looks a mite bigger inside the game. Jumping over this pit is easy, remember? We can do this backwards with our eyes closed. Aah! I'm burning! Jake!  What, man? Wha?! Jake, what the shank? Check it out -- extra lives. You still have two left.  Aah-ha! Ow! It burns! Ow! Aah-ha! Jake!  Do, do-do-do  Dude, what if losing all your lives in here makes you die in real life? Or worse? That makes me just want to sit here and feel bad. No way, man. We're gonna cross that hole with real-world grit. Come on! Faster, Jake. Get ready to stretch it. Watch out, Jake! Wow! Whew! That was pretty intense, dude. We're pretty intense dudes. Yeah!

Curse this false virtual world.  Oh, Finn. Yo, what up? Oh, Finn! You're alive. Yeah, I got extra lives, man. Oh, my gosh. Let's never die again. There's nothing more precious than a life. Ooh, dude, look -- coins. Oh, man! Oh, man! Hee, hee, hee. Ooh! Oh, man, dude, these coins are thick. Let's take them back to the real world. We'll be filthy, stinking rich. Whoa! BOTH: Hunny Bunny! N-o-o-o! Time to use the bombuh. Come to me, bombuh. Bombuh! Oh, bombuh, I can't select you without my controller.  Let's get out of here, Finn. Man, we never run away from Hunny Bunny.  Aah! Fire pit, Bouncy Bee, Hunny Bunny -- they're supposed to be the easy parts. They're all hard as butts. Sleepy Sam is gonna be the ultimate butt-kicker. Look, Finn, the most important thing to remember is that I still have one giant coin. Man, get ahold of your brains. We need to stay alert for Sleepy Sam. Hey, that's him right there. Get down. What's he doing? He's probably trying to psyche me out. I'm gonna break you, Sam. When I'm done, they'll call you, uh Stinky Sam stupid frog. Aah!  Ugh! My -- my mitts didn't -- didn't work. Come on, help me punch him. Okay! Roar! Let's get out of here, man! We're gonna die!  I can see the lights. We're almost there! Ugh! Oh, no, man. It's the edge of the screen. We're trapped, and they'll be here any second. Wait, dude. The bombuh. We can't get the bombuh. Wait, dude. Hmm. - Jake? Jake? What if I FINN: That's not how it works.  Error, error, error. Jake, let go of that. But we need the bombuh.  Whoops.  Finn!  Huh?  Oh, holy cow! That was nuts, man! Yeah, man. And I got my coin. What?! A penny?!  Beemo! Oh, no! Are you all right, buddy?  You -- you have to -- y-you -- Oh, no! Too late! Run! Aah! No. No. No. Don't kill us. We don't have extra lives. No! Whoa, wait. Hold up, guys. Check it out. Sunshine. Oh, boy. That feels good. All right. See you later, Sam. You mean that's it? You're not gonna kill us?  No, of course not. The game's over. We won. All we wanted was the sunshine and to kill that computer that's been imprisoning us for so many years. What? Help! Oh, no! BOTH: Beemo! Oh, sure, he's dangerous. If he hits his button again, back we go. Beemo, quick! Hit your button! I-I can't, Finn. I'm stuck. You want him to hit his button?! What's wrong with you?! We'll save you, Beemo. Finn, go! They're too strong. Use the combo move, Finn. The combo move! Combo move? That never works. Listen, you got this, man. I know you -- I know you can do it, buddy. You got this! Okay, okay.

I was goofing off, got hurt. - Now I got a little brother. I named him Kent. - I'm Kent. - Whoa! A talking brother! - You can chop up a worm and get two? - I thought that was a myth. - Myth is a powerful force in my life, dude. So, the thing is, I don't know beans about being a big brother. - Can you give me some tips? - Ah, it's easy. You just give him something - sharp and get him to fight bad guys. - That's it? Yeah, you might have to stretch all big if he gets in real trouble. - But, yeah. - All right. Sounds good. Someday, you'll be Kent's food. - Oh, wow! - Hey, how did you do that? - I don't know. Hmm. Okay, Kent. This is for real important. You are my little brother, so your purpose is to fight bad guys. So go fight some bad guys! - Or girls. Don't discriminate. - Oh! Okay, brother. Boo-oop! Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop! A bad guy. Hey! Let's fight! Get back here! Don't run! I'm super new at fights. And at being alive. - Hi! - Who are you? Where am I? Why do my parts hurt? Oh, good! You're awake. I am Leaf Beard. I found you blonked out and bruised in the tunnels. But if you drink of our dewdrops, - it will fix up all your ouchies. - Oh! The Rat King has made his way to our end of the roots. You should be more careful. Oh! Oh, okay. What's a Rat King? - Oh! You're not from the roots. - I'm from my brother's butt. Maybe. The Rat King's been destroying our home, chewing up the roots of this tree. This tree that gives us life! Life! - Hey! - So, he's a bad guy? - So sick nasty bad. That means I got to fight him. That's what my brother said to do! - Where's my sword? - Your sword was shattered to - butts when I found you. - Oh Bummer. - Yes. - Bums. - What do I do? Um I don't know. But the blacksmith could make you a new one, probably. That's who I am. And I am very good at me. Okay, so, like, the Rat King has been messing up the roots, yeah? Chewing on them with his teeth. The sword has to be made of the strongest tree stuff so even his teeth can't break it! Bring me the freshest ingredients and I'll do it up. Follow the sound of the singing crystal. - There you'll find the first element. - Boo! - Cool, cool. Ha! - Greetings. Hey, man! I'm looking for some unbreakable ore. Y'all got that here? I have what you seek. But consider this instead. I offer you this treasure of glittering emeralds. You'll be infinitely rich and - live the rest of your days in comfort. - No, I'm good. - Just the ore, please. - Oh! Well done. By resisting the temptation - of wealth, you have passed my test. - Nah, I just don't care about money. My name's Kent. I'm supposed to fight bad guys. All right. That's pretty weird, but Here you go The unbreakable ore. - Uh - Could you just Yeah. - Oh, there. There she goes! - Ha, ha! Boop, boop, ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop, boop, boop, boop. - Whoop, whoop! - Greetings. Come to fight me, eh? My name is Kent, and if I had a sword, I'd totally fight you. But for now, I'm looking for a clod of mystic earth. Yes. I have what you seek. But consider this instead. I offer you the hand of one of my beautiful daughters. You'll become a good husband and - live the rest of your days in true love. - Nah, I don't care about being a good husband or wife or whatever. All's I care about is fighting bad guys! Dang, homes, that's cold. Here you go. Mystic earth. - Greetings. - Dude, you know why I'm here! Yeah. And I got what you want. But consider this instead. Hyah! Drink this sap, and you'll have life eternal. You'll never meet death and - you'll outlast the world. - Um I was born earlier today, so I don't really get a sense of my own mortality. No, thank you. Hyah! The sacred flame. Oh, what? I name this sword Punch party! I feel so cool right now. - It's party time. Whoa! Uh! - Greetings. - Who's there? - I am the Rat King. Why are you here? I've got, like, this rad sword, and I'm gonna fight you with it. - Yes! - Who are you fighting me for? Your brother? - What? - Instead, why don't you join me? I offer you cosmic power. You'll be a king and live the rest of your days as a god. You're messing up the tree, and I totally live here! You're a bad guy! - Yeah. - Don't do that! - How do you plan to defeat me? - I'm Making This Up As I go! Dang. Having a brother around looks kind of fun.  Where are you, little brother? Are you happy or do you feel weird? Have you changed a lot or not? Are you ever gonna come back here? I shouldn't have been so hasty You were just a little baby, or maybe you weren't I'm not really sure how little brothers work You were the first friend I ever had No one can compare Together we could probably fight a bear, so if you're ever sad/lonely Right here next to you, 'cause that's what big brothers are supposed to do  - Whoa! - Kent proceeded to relate his fantastic journey to me. It was all super good. But he had also partaken of the food of the underworld, and so he was compelled to return there by dewdrop law. That's what he said, at least. Maybe he was having second thoughts about infinite riches, true love, and eternal life. Or maybe he had just decided that fighting bad guys wasn't really his deal. But I do know this Free from the Rat King's cursed teeth, that spring, for the first time in many years, the Willow Tree was in bloom.


  "Evil is rising. In vile power, the fiend walks among us again The Vampire King. With all my investigations into the supernatural, I should know better, but I can't help it. I'm dying to see him in person!" I probably will die if I see him in person. Hello? Yo, yo, yo, yo! Bubblegum sent me for the bucket. - Dozo. - Merci and adios. Wait! Uh, how's it going? It's good, you know? Uh, Marceline's got all her powers back. She's getting ready to give The Vampire King a big, fat whompin', uh, I hope. Um, while that's going down, do you think you could ask The V.K. to sign something for me? That would be weird. You're weird.  Makin' stake-uhs, makin' mega-stake-uhs Take some stake-uhs, and I make a mega-stake-uh  I dreamed about you while I was in my poison coma. I was all old and withered, and you were still nice and pink. You think I'm nice? Aw, brains, I lost count! That's okay. I'm done with bat Jacks. I have this weird feeling in my tums. 'Cause you're scared of The Vampire King? No, it's not fear. I know what that feels like. So maybe it's love? Ohh! What is it?! It's the herald of a new snack dawn! Oh, yeah. I arranged a little snacky-snack for the team. I love you, Bonnibel. Yeah, me too, Bonnibel. Oh! Holy macaroni! Can we do this all the time? Later, we can, all the time. But for now-now, we got to get our plan together. Easy first, take down The V.K., kill him, destroy him, and Kill him! I like this plan! It's got good bones! Well, the devil's in the details. Like, how do we even find him? Vampire King: I come to you! Vampire King! In the flesh! Not for long, sucka! Whoa! I just want to talk. Oh, really? Why don't you step inside for a nice chat?! Aah! No, thank you. Whoa-oh-oh! Just hear me out, Marceline. Hear this! Yowch! Will you calm down and listen to Shoot. Sorry. Stay calm. And nobody gets hurt. I know what you must think of me. And you'd be right. My thirst for blood is an awesome force. But in these new times, I have a chance to try A different course. I think I want to Roll out! Thorn arm Activate! You gonna help or what? Let me finish my thought. Stake you! Okay, go ahead. This is the old way Agents of darkness and light in a tug-of-war. But now a creature can step out of that struggle. In this age, why would I want be the Vampire King anymore. I don't know. Why would you?! I wouldn't. I submit. Remove the vampire essence from my blood. Free me from the shackles of my station. Hyah! Finn, what the heck?! It's against my code to strike a foe who's raised their bottom to the sky. The enchiridion explicitly states so. - Demma your rules. - Demma good rule, dough. Out of my way! Look, eh? Look at these babies These pleading puppies. Hyah! Ohh! Whoops! Should have staked him. How many times do you want to do this, Marceline? Our lives are magnetized. We're in a negative loop. But we can change our outcome this time! I like the outcome where you get staked! And you become a vampire? Marceline I know I was ruthless in the past, but tell me, what's the one thing you've noticed about the world since you beat me all those hundreds of years ago? Everything repeats over and over again. No one learns anything because no one lives long enough to see the pattern, I guess. But you've lived long enough. I know, duh. And you still think this is the right way Fighting me? The other way's like a black hole an unknown. So let's consult a witch. No witches. I'm not afraid of the unknown! I have the power to change destiny! Queen of vampires! You weigh the scales of fate! Spill my guts or face the unknown! Either way, I will not bite! For turning you would subjugate me to the wheel of fortune, and I am a king, not a hamster. My path runs straight into the void on a sick flaming chariot! - Whoa! - Whoa! Stake me! I will not hide! Do it, chicken! You make me sick! Okay, dag! - We'll take your stupid thing out! - My what? - Your dang vamp juice, come on! - Cool. - Finn: Let 'er rip! - Bubblegum: Wait! Huh? Aah! Whoops! - Truce, you guys. - No funny business. "No funny business" us or you?! Him. What happened to your pants? - Uh - Hold that thought! Oof! Finish him! Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam! Finn, you can stop. Oh, okay, now we're stopping. - Sorry, dude. - It's chill. See? No funny business. - Hey, Jake? - What? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Peppermint Butler: Be cool. Be like, "how's it going, V.K.? I'm Peppermint B., and I know all about you." No. That sounds lame. "Yo, V.K., sign my book, jerk!" No. We're home! Is the lab ready? Of course. Is he here? Hey. Say something! Ask him to sign the book! Uh Do it! He's getting away! Wait! Just a sec! Can you sign Sorry, too late. Hey, peppermint Butler, I can hear your brains. Look inside your book. Okay, shields down, everybody! A psychic autograph! Thank you, Your Darkness. Here we go! Aaaaah! Wh-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oa! His vampire essence is now completely drained. Well, let's see what we've got left. Kitty! Best makeover ever! Mmm. Bubblegum: Hey, Pep. Milady? Are you sure your peepers are all right? My inner vision is extraordinarily developed. Okay, great, 'cause I need you to go into the secret catacombs and bury this nasty bucket of sludge in the deep, deep down. Just be uber-duber careful not to drop it. Pure vampire essence this powerful could kaboom reality off its whack. - Don't drop the bucket. - Exactly. Will do. Whoa! Unh! Aaaaah! N-o-o-o-o-o-o! Whew! Mm, bucky. N-o-o-o-o-o

I want to go to sleep, and you're creeping me the math out! Whoa, man! Let me try Diplomat style. Pardon me horse, I beseech thou to split my land, this night.

Dude, poo-brain means that we can lure it away from here using music. Everything brainless likes music. That's true! You're a genius! All right horse, prepare to get lured! (Plays Beethoven's "Moonlight Sanata") Follow me, Horsie. Jake? It's not luring! Huh? Hmmm. So, Beethoven is not luring enough for you, is it? Well, how about some Mozart?!

And get a giant hawkâ Caaaww!--To kill him! Wah?! Caaawww! Caaawwwwww! No, man! That is wrong. Oh. Did I say the hawk would kill him? I meant that the hawk would swoop down gently and take him away to an island of sunshine and love-stuff and take care of him. Whoa. That sounds awesome. What do think? It looks like a bunny? (whistles) Hey hawks, c'mon! Jake I think I see a hawk or two. Cause more commotion to help the hawks! Ahhh! Blblblblblblblblblbl! Take the bunny! Riiiiight here! -Yeah! -Yeah! -Right here! -Here! Hold him and fly away! The bunny! The bunny! What a beautiful sight. We did it! Back to sleep! Haha! Good night, buddy. Good night, buddy. Ahh! It's in our house now! That's obvious, Finn! You don't have to say that out loud! Hey, this is all your fault, dude! If you weren't so darn handsome, animals wouldn't always be staring at you! You're just mad at me for being Handsome? Yeah, well, you're the one who told me to lure snakes! Ahhh! I told you to lure the horse! You lured the snakes! There's even one here in my underpants! (sigh) Wait a minute, dude. Can you see what this horse is doing? It's tearing us apart. Aw, man.. You're right! We have to get rid of this horse - for us! I know, bro. I know. Oh, Finn; this horse is bringing us together now.

What are you going to do? Say that to me again. What are you going to do?! Do Doo-doo. I'm going to kick that horse in the bottom! Oh, my Grod! The Ice King?! I should go. You were spying on us?! That's none of your business! He was trying to learn our bedtime secrets! (gasps) Were you? (gasps) He was! Did you find out that I sleep "in the nude"? (Hums) It's none of your business how nude I sleep, Ice King! Nnnnone of your business! Gentlemen. I'll see you later. Hmph! (Whistling) (Hisses) Here's your sword, dude! Thank you. Jake! Jake! Look out! Tell us why you were spying! Snakes! Quick! Throw them to the Ice King. What's he doing? He's using his ice powers! Ow, ouch, ow! Is that all the ice you have? Aaaaah Yeeesss. Well, you should really have. More! Well, we don't need anymore. What if you had guests? Guests bring their own ice! Tell us why you were spying on us or we'll We'll cut off your stupid head! Yeah, and make it quick cause we're both really sleepy. Ok, ok. I'll tell you. I was watching you  To learn how to be happy. -What? -Huh? It's true! I would like to be happy like you guys. But, I have no idea how. So,you dressed up like a horse? Have pity on me. I've been so sad and miserable, I cry all the time. But, whenever I see you two, you always look so happy. But, they're just hopping each other. So yes, I've decided to spy on you, dressed as a horse. But.. I guess my plan failed. All I observed was you two arguing over How to get rid of me. Hey, are you sleeping? (gasp)Is this it? Sleeping? Could it be that all I need is a good night's rest? I'm Still not happy.

He's the farm, the legendary fighter of the shiney isles. I came here to participate in his open challenge, but this mother can't be beat! Give up, worms! My fight power is supreme! I'm too freaking legendary for you!  ALL:  Train! Train! Train! FINN: Whoa! Train! Train! Train! Train! I love you, the train! You're almost as legendary as the farm, the train! The train is gonna smack you down on his tracks! Whoo! Your caboose is mine! Choo-choo! Choo-choo! FINN: Oh, my glob. Choo! Ow! My legs are backwards!  Why? Ohh! You're mean!  FINN: Did you just die?

JAKE: You don't want bionic legs. It ain't natchy. FINN: I don't care about natchy. JAKE: Let's discuss this later.  You guys want to fight me? FINN: You think we can beat him? JAKE: Yeah way, we can't. He's the ultimate! FINN: But if we beat him, we'll be crazy legends. JAKE: Man, I already am a legend in other aspects of life. Third highest score in "kompy's kastle," brah. Third. In the candy kingdom. FINN: Jake, that's your legend. This could be our legend! Brogend! JAKE: Okay, how are we gonna beat him, then? FINN: Train! JAKE: He can't even walk. FINN: No, man. "Train up," like "get ripped!" JAKE: Yeah, I was just kidding. Let's destroy that guy! FINN: We're coming back for you, the farm!

FINN: Winning this battle could take our reputation to a whole new level! JAKE: Look, I'm a full-grown dog of my own, and I need to play "kompy's kastle" every day so I can maintain my rank. FINN: SoYou don't care about fighting the farm? JAKE: I never really take anything seriously. Except "kompy's kastle." FINN: Hy-ah! JAKE: Komp-y-y-y!!  I'm gonna break every bone in your body, then heal you later with that magical goo we got from the cyclops's eye.  Aah! FINN: Ouch. JAKE: Apologize! FINN:  Never!  JAKE: I'm gonna turn up the juice! FINN: And I'm gonna drink it! JAKE:  My little face!  Ow!  Where are you? Huh? Huh? FINN:  JAKE: Huh? FINN: Apologize for not taking training seriously!  JAKE: Come out, you chicken nug!  Ow.

FINN: Yeah, that's right. Come and get this. So, what -- both at the same time? I'm cool. You're gonna fight this, the farm?  Okay. FINN: Just me. I don't need this clown town. JAKE: The only way you're gonna win is if you use your cheap moves. FINN: JAKE: Hey, come on. You got to fight the dude.  FINN:  I can't see! Walk me to the light! JAKE: Yeah, that's what you get. FINN: Cloud looks like a car.  Awaken to your dream, finn and Jake. FINN: Whoa! Who are you? I am the dream warrior. I've summoned you here to hang with me in your together dream. FINN: Are you gonna show us a move to beat the farm? First, listen. Then wake up. FINN: All right. I have cheap cars. My cars are che-e-e-ap. BOTH: My cars are cheap. But they drive bad when I turn out the lights! BOTH: Turn out the lights. These sweatpants have another name. BOTH: Another name. FINN: Yeah, don't you always call sweatpants "give up on life" pants, Jake? JAKE: I do, because peeps need to respect themselves when they leave the house, even if it's just for ice cream or t.P. Or whatevs. Two shiny golden apples, ripe enough to bite! BOTH: Bite!  That's all I got to say for now. Get lost! JAKE: What is going on here, dream warrior? FINN: Yeah, what's this all about? Nap's over! Sorry!  FINN: Whoa. That was a good nap. JAKE: Hey, did you dream about dream warrior? FINN: Yeah. What was he trying to tell us exactly? JAKE: I don't know. I didn't get it. But listen, man. I'm sorry I got mad at you. Who cares about my high score in "kompy"? It ain't important. FINN: No, man. It is important. Being the third best at something is math and deserves respect, not like I did to "kompy." Anyway, I think we both got cranky after all that training. JAKE: Well, good thing we're rested, 'cause now we can beat this beast. FINN: Yeah! Oh, hey! Look!  JAKE: The dudes came back to watch us fight! FINN: A'ight. This is it. Let's use what we learned in training. JAKE: Uh All we did was fight dirty with cheap -- wait. My cars are che-e-ap. Che-e-ap. JAKE: Dream warrior was telling us which cheap moves to use on the farm! Headlights mean eyes! FINN: Mud in the eyes! JAKE: Give up on life pants! FINN: Pull down his pants like you did to moi! JAKE: Two golden apples! FINN: Mm I think I know what that means. JAKE: Well, sure, I can make a wild guess. FINN: You ready, man? JAKE: Yeah, dude! Put your pants on. FINN:  Okay.    JAKE: Ready? Yes. JAKE:   FINN: That was awesome! All right, all right, my turn.   You guys are full of magic air. JAKE: FINN: Gross!  No! Princess? YouOkay? Yeah. It's justThe air smells bad from your magic tricks, and now I feel sad. I left all my scented candles at the castle. They'd really cut through the magic stank. JAKE: Just go back to the fire kingdom and get them -- problem solved.  Then I'll have to see my dad. I'm still mad at him for imprisoning me in that lantern. So unfair!  FINN: UhWe can go get them? Really? That would be really nice. But don't let my pops see you. I don't want his majesty thinking I need anything from him.  JAKE: It ain't me!  ALL: Whoa!  Oh!  JAKE: Flambo! For a second I thought the princess was farting. FINN: Flambo, we need you to cast "flame shield" on us. All right!  FINN: These candles must be they. JAKE:  They smell like an old lady's bathroom. FINN: Hey! Don't disrespect my lady! JAKE: I say it as a compliment! Like it reminds me of my grandma. I love my grandma. No one come-s-s-s here. FINN:  Not s-since flame princes-s-s fled the cas-s-tle. Now gues-s-s what we're gonna kill flame king with. FINN:  A conspirator with a hiss voice! How aboutWater? Even wors-s-e! We'll us-s-e ic-c-e! FINN: And a conspirator with an untied shoe! Ice?

We got to stop those guys from killing flame princess' dad! JAKE: Right, right. FINN: Dirt bags! Where'd they go? JAKE: Hey, is that new? Yeah, I think it is. Yes, it is new. Hmm, what do you guys think of this painting? I like it. Hey, is this one of those paintings where the eyes follow you? FINN:  Hmm. Hmm. Come on, let's get out of here. I don't want to miss snack time. Snacks! Snacks! Snacks! ALL: Snacks! Snacks! Snacks!  JAKE: Now what? and most unnatural murder-s-s. FINN: Hear that? It sounds like a voice with a hiss. JAKE: The kind we are looking for! The s-serpent that did s-sting FINN: Stop! thy father's life, now wears hi-s-s crown-s-s! JAKE: Dude, the voice! FINN: We must follow the voice! To die, to s-sleep, to s-sleep, perchance to dream FINN: Which way is the hiss voice coming from? Aye, there's the rub, for in that s-sleep of death JAKE: This way! what dream-s-s may come. FINN: Which way? I s-seem to be s-saying a lot about our s-super-s-secret plan JAKE: To the left! You!  BOTH: You! You! You! BOTH: Double you! Double you! JAKE: I don't think it's them. BOTH: Double you! Double you! JAKE: Whoa!  FINN: Jake! JAKE: I'm okay! I think I hear that hissing voice down this way! FINN: Whoa!  Why didn't you catch me? JAKE: Oops! Tell me next time. I can't think in the future. Vent ahead. FINN: Jake, I want to see.  FINN: No hissing. JAKE: No untied shoe. Vent.  This needs something more! Yes!  Yes! That's the  Stuff! FINN: Whoa! It's him!  Hmm? My bluebies!  JAKE: You buffoon! Where's your partner with the untied shoe? What partner? What are you blueberries  talking about? FINN: Give it up, man! I heard your hiss voice! I don't have a  voice! There's a  snake on your shoulder! FINN: What?  FINN: Aah! JAKE: Hmm.  JAKE: Suffering  JAKE: Succotash! Now to chop you two big blueberries into small, bite-sized blueberries!  Shakespeare. Five minutes to curtain, everyone! Five minutes! FINN: I'm sorry! I'm sorry!  Ooh!  Oh! Pfft! Actors! FINN: What's going on with the costumes? This is a theater troupe! We're getting ready to perform for the king! Everyone in the kingdom shall be in attendance! Of course, you know all this, being fellow actors from the exact same troupe. JAKE: I have an idea. We'll go onstage, act like two conspirators. You will have one shoe untied, I will talk with a hiss voice. We'll talk about how we want to kill the king. As we do this, we'll study the faces of the audience and look for guilty reactions. FINN: That's brilliant! JAKE: Thanks! It's an original idea by me.  FINN: Ahem! Hey, conspirator! JAKE: Hey, co-conspirator! FINN: Let's talk about how we're gonna kill the king! JAKE: Shh! S-somebody might hear our evil plot! Man, I am so lost. JAKE: Psst! The audience! Uh, uh, uh, uh Uh, uh  JAKE: You think that's one of them? FINN: Maybe. Let's keep going. So, what are you packing? JAKE: Water, man -- enough of it to put out the king's fire! Uh, uhHmm.  FINN: I think he's starting to crack. Water? You know what's even more painful? If we pour ice in his ear! That's how we'll kill the flame king! Pbht! Kill the flame king? This is treason disguised as a play! Guards, seize them! FINN: What?! No!  Please! We were trying to warn you about assassins! Hmm. Search them! FINN:  Huh?  Sire, it's your daughter's scented candles! FINN: I-I-I Sickos! Off with their heads! JAKE: Whoa, what?!  FINN: No, please! S-stay s-still. FINN: "S-still"?

  Road trip! Check out this sweet make-out wagon! Life-giving magus bro! - Yo, yo, yo! - Yo, yo! Ron James bro! - Whazzup! - Not much, not much. Finn's old hat bro! - Uh, name's "Little Dude". - Sure, sure. Hey, uh - It's Beau. Beau bro, right! Leaf man bro! And, uh - Who's this guy? - I don't know. We just picked him up. That's the kind of trip this is gonna be. It's a "destiny will guide us" kind of thing. How 'bout we call you Giuseppe. That's right, Giuseppe. - Okay, Ron James, it's time. - A'ight, listen up, brahs. Here's the plan. - Oooh! - We're heading for big butt rock. At sundown, we'll gather on the cheek's peak, and using the ah-has, deep feels and woo-woos we score from the journey, we will chant a totally original spell, thus forming an entirely new school of magic! Kind of like those jerky secret societies, but less jerky. Just got one more stop. Finn and Jake's crib? They won't come. They're out of our league. Hey, Abracadaniel's here, with a bus full of lame wizards. Here we go. They're probably gonna try to lure us on some dumb trip. Hey, water nymphs! Uh Hi! Uh Do you girls feel like, uh - Going on a road trip? - No thanks. - Okay, but what if I - Hey, ladies! Hellooo! - Whoa, do you guys know this person? No, but his eyes are just Gorge! - Oh! - Here we go! - Why'd we stop? - I think we ran out of gas. And the wheels fell off! Well, this ain't goin' the way we planned, but fate has decreed that this place is just what we need. Draw your inspiration from this muddy, old cow pasture. Here, bros. We got a full stock of T.P. and magic ink. Let's all write down arcane, cryptic words in unexpected new combinations and patterns. Maybe the nymphs can dance on top of the bus to be, like, our muses. - Inspire us, water nymphs! - We don't want to. We'd rather write. I'll dance if dancing is needed. * Doo-doo doo doo-doo *  Yah yah! Doo-doo wah! Dance, dance, dancin' dance writing, I'm dance, dance, dance, dancin' Top of the bus, window  - Hey, check it out, y'all! - The dirty old stranger's writing, too. - What's all the ruckus?! I own this pasture, so git back in your vehicle and git! We can't! Our wheels fell off! Back on the vehicle. I'll make a slick ice road. Are you gone? I can't really see! Is there a problem? - I ran out of juice. - Can I take over? Yeah, maybe you should. Hey, let's switch headgear. - Oh, it fits! - Yeah, girl, let the ice magic flow. - Oh, but be careful, okay? - What? Oh! Not me. - Nice ice road! - Thanks. Hey, I don't think we're moving. - Hold on. Everyone, time to push the bus! - Eh, I don't really want to. Come on! Destiny! Push! Okay, back on the bus! Back on the bus! Huh? Oh, a crabapple tree. Giuseppe, make yourself useful and grab us some of them crabapples. Get ready! - Jump! - Oh, no! Giuseppe can't catch up! What?! Magus of life giving, take the wheel! Uh, okay, but I am not a confident driver. - You're doing great, buddy. - Don't touch me! Giuseppe, throw the crabapples! Giuseppe? We have lost Giuseppe. Mm! Hmm? Well, let's see what old Giuseppe wrote. Listen to this, everybody! "These are not my tear drops, daughter dear, but just a sheen of dew that lingers here, past other fields where other fathers lie who kept their daughters better far than I." What do you guys think? What's wrong with you guys? Looks who talking. Huh? This is true art. Well, let's see what you other guys wrote. Little Dude, here's yours. "Days don't have shades directions with no ways adjusting minimum scholarly curriculum to enrich empty minds it takes refracted sunshines." That is awesome! "Take this light with your great might free hearts that are gated seeing truth in things exaggerated." Ah, some interesting spell combos going on, guys. - Ice King! I see the butt rock! - The hour of glory is upon us. Cauldron! Smells so good down here! What's cooking? Girls, we can help. Okay, one, two, three! Lift! Ow! Ow! Um Let's get out of here. No, don't go! Hey, I could freeze all of us. Then we'd be safe from drowning, and once someone discovers our preserved bodies, we'll be saved! Be like 200 years, tops! - Oh! Let me try this! Mommy! - Oh, grog! I can't swim! - Ah! Oh, glob! - Ymmom! - Somebody! - Sorry. - I was hoping it wouldn't come to this My "last resort" poshe, obtained from a mad yogi in the mystery mountains. It's time to find out what it does. Ba-bam! Nice and slow. Oh, gent Oh! Oh, I'm flying! Yoink. Take my head away from here, baby! No! Maybe this is a test from Destiny, guys! If we all just surrender to these events, the answer will reveal itself. - Whoa! - Wha? Hey, it's Giuseppe! - Giuseppe, how have you done this? - Whoa! - What was he? - I don't know, Abracadaniel, but I think he was trying to show us something Something new. Sploo! Jicka haka boogy noona hubba gubba Secret wizard handshake! - Later, Chinchizerd. - Bye, Berdzerd. See you at the secret thing tonight! Loser. Giuseppe.


      JAKE: And as it waded through the carnage it had wrought, the vampire smashed their skulls just for the fun of it! No way! Yes way! lt did! And, also, the vampire hunched over its victims and breathed their vaporized blood mist!  Ah, geez! Jake, is this stuff you're saying true, or are you just trying to mess me up? You have to be honest. Oh, it's true, man. l heard it through a reliable source. Reliable? Rats. Yeah, some say it haunted this very tree! - This tree?! - Good night! - Jake! -  You're full of it, Jake! JAKE:   No worms on the bed!  Huh?  Huh? Jake! Jake! l saw someone outside the window! lt must be the vampire, and l think we're unprepared, so l -- Relax, buddy. l made that story up. l was just trying to scare you. But you said you heard it from reliable source.  l made that up, too. l was trying to scare you, and it worked!  Whoa! No one's outside. Whew! lt was just the wind, scaredy-cat. l wasn't scared. l was slnglng. l was singing my scream song.  Aah, aah, aah!  You're a total wuss, man. -  - Hey, guys. What's up? l'm Marceline the Vampire Queen. Are you gonna smash my skull and breathe my blood mist?! Don't suck our blood!  Calm down, weenies. l'm not gonna do that. So You don't suck blood? Sometimes l do, but it's not the blood that l like. lt's the color. l eat shades of red. Golly!  Mmm! Wow, l'm exhausted. l've been traveling all over the Land of Ooo, and l've seen some stuff that would really make you say, ''like what?''  Like what? l found a School of Goldfish Beasts. Yah! Yee-haw! And l fooled around in the Fire Kingdom.  Ooh! Oh, and check these out. FlNN: Nuts? Oh, these aren't just ordlnary nuts.  You're wonderful. Yeah, uh, thank you for not sucking our blood. You guys seem cool, too.  But as you can imagine, l'm really tired, so you two should probably get going. What?  Look. ''M'' for ''Marceline.'' Oh, man. l carved it in this tree years ago -- long before you two rascals started squatting here. But seriously, guys, thanks for keeping the place warm for me. Like, really great. Thanks. Huh? Good night! Come on, Finn, let's get out of here! She can't kick us out of our house! No, Finn, wait! Get down here, lady, and fight me! She's a vampire, dude!  What?!   l'm gonna kill her! Dude, if half the stories l've heard and/or made up are true, vamplres wlll kill you. There's no question. But what about our home? A vampire took it! Ah, we should go house hunting -- bag us a new house. But l like our home. Finn, house hunting is wild! You got to try it! Really? Yeah, man. lt is so nuts! You always know what to say.

Finn, let me tell you a little something about what ''home'' really means.  La la la Home isn't a place Let me give you a clue Home is anywhere where people care about you  l don't want to hear a lecture, dude. l just want to go home.  But home is where your heart is, Finn And where is your heart, Finn? Well, it's right there inside you Well, l'm sitting right here beside you  With your lucky stars to guide you from above. Yeah, l guess l'd rather be out here, wrapped in your ear, than be in some awesome house all by my souse. JAKE: l'd rather be dancing with some babes. FlNN: Shut up, dude! JAKE: Gross. This place looks gross. And abandoned.  And abandoned. And abandoned. And abandoned. Whoa, bro! Want to just live in here? Yes.  So, they cleaned the cave and built a house inside the cave So, what do you think, man? We did pretty good for ourselves. Yeah, we did. So, uh, what should we do first in our new digs? Let's trash it and throw a party!  This is it. Feeling good. Feeling -- l'm feeling like we did it. l'm feeling, like, completely satisfied. Nothing else can go wrong, you know, Jake? - Yeah, man. - Oh, yeah. l know, too. Hey, Finn. -  She's back! Wow, pretty awesome party you got here. What do you want, Marceline? Oh, l just want to show you something. This cave belongs to me! What?! Thanks for fixing the place up for me. You -- you can't take our home twice!  Yes, l ca-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-n  Aah! lt's vampire-fighting time! Finn, no! Vampires will klll you, remember? But she's taking our home again! We're home as long as we're together! Blah, blah, blee, blah, bloop, remember? Oh, yeah. Okay, Marceline, l'm gonna let you keep this cave, but only because Jake is my home. And he's way better than all your homes combined! You know, you're right. l guess l'll take him, too! What?! l'll bite him a little Aah! maybe turn him into a zombie. No! - Let go of Jake! - Make me.  You okay, pal?  No one makes me let go of Jake! l'm not scared of you!  You're pathetic, little boy. You're pathetic!  Get ready for an uppercut, you dog! Make me.  Blah, blah! Blah! l got to help my buddy! Your blood is mine! -  - Uh-oh.   Ow! That actually hurt, Finn.  Mwah! W-Why you didn't just kill me? 'Cause that was fun! Whew, l haven't fought like that in years. Thanks, Finn. Finn. A-Aren't you dead? Nah, before she bit me, l used my powers to shrink all my guts and blood over to my thumb, see?  You two are pretty hard core. l can appreciate that. So so does that mean we can have our old house back? Yeah, keep it as a gift from me! Blah! BOTH: Yeah! Huh? Did you guys get on the bed? l told you, you're not allowed! MAN: Oh, hey, guys. BOTH: Huh? Come here, friends. Hug me.  Oh, yeah. Hug me. 


    - Jake, you made this? - Yeah. And you buried the treasure right here? Uh-huh. Jake, you're awesome!  This is so cool. BOTH:  FINN: A suitcase? Oh, man! I found it in the dump and then buried it without looking inside. Whoa. Wait a second, man. I know this case. One night, while you were away at Lady's house, I was dancing in the woods. ICE KING: Evil tapes. Evil! Perchance, I saw the Ice King doing something suspicious. So I trailed him to the dump, where he buried this case in the ground. You're evil tapes! Full of evil secrets! That's why I'm going to bury you where no one will ever find you under all these boogers! Whee!  Whee!  FINN: I waited for him to leave. But he played in those boogers for hours. I decided to come back later for the case. But I lost track of it. - Whoa! And I found it? - Mm-hmm.  Let's have a secret screening. I'll make some fliers for it. There, now nobody will bother us. FINN: Jake! Jake, come on! Okay, you can play this, right, Beemo? Yes, Finn. It goes in my butt. Oh. This is so exciting! Hello, dear diary. Pretty good day so far. Got up bright and early, had a healthy and slimming breakfast, did 14 minutes of cardio. Dude, what are we watching? I think it's the Ice King's diary. I mean, I'm not gonna win carpenter of the year or anything, but it's a place to hang up the old toothbrush. Wenk. Gunter. Hey, Gunter. Get -- getaway from the camera, sweetie. Papa's recording his innermost thoughts. Remember, I explained this to you? Hey, Gunter. Gunter! - Wenk. Well, anyway, as you can see, I'm not wearing my -- Wenk. I'm not wearing my -- Wenk, wenk. Sweetie, I raised my voice because you were giving me the silent treatment. You understand? - Wenk. I love you. Can we fast-forward? N-No, man, we might miss something.  There must be more to life than this. Wenk. I know, you don't like when I'm contemplative. C-Contemplative? No. Con-tem-plat-- C-- let's put on a play! What?!  Oh, Ice King, you're so cool! You take such good care of yourself! I want to be with you! Wenk, wenk, wenk!  No, Gunter, beard stays on. Wenk. ICE KING: Gunter, I need you to wear the beard! - Wenk. - Gunter! Hey, pause it, Beemo. There's got to be some evil secrets in here. I want to keep watching. Okay- Well, why don't I make us some snacks? So I don't have to watch this. Can we sit on the floor? I feel so far away from you guys. Wenk.  Aha! Now hold still. You moved! Ooh, what's this?  Secret tapes?! I wanna watch! Catch you later, Gunter. Wenk. Gunter, no! Gunter! Dance p-- Gunter! Dance party!  Thanks, Gunter.  Mmm! You're Gunter.  Wenk, wenk, wenk, wenk. Oh, fine, who needs you? More dance party for us. Right, Gunter? Oh! Uh  May I have this dance?  There's probably some evil secrets coming up.  Someone wants to see the secret tapes! What?! Oh, but I was so clear in my flier. Let's peek through the window and check who it is. Maybe it's just a pizza. Right! - Hey, hey! - BOTH: What?! You guys are checking too loud! Oh, you're right. More quietly.  I'm quieter now. Cool.  Hey. guys, it's me. Can I come in and watch the secret tapes with you? I brought some gifts. BOTH: Aah! Okay, if we're quiet long enough, Ice King will think no one's home and go away.  Ah, no one's home. Guess I'll go away.  Aah! Aah! Ohh! Huh?  Just turn your alarm off! Hmm, that sounds like Beemo.  My alarm says it's time for Finn's bath. Finn, get naked. No, just hit your snooze button! I cannot self-snooze. It's against my programming. Well, then, tell me how to do it!  Press and hold, then press the button on top of my head.  BOTH: Phew! I'm sorry. We can still take a bath.  He must know we're watching his tapes. We need to find his secrets faster.  Oh, diary, thank you for listening to me.  Fast-forward, Beemo.  Sorry, been meaning to tell you something insanely private. But darest I? I love to  fill my bathtub full of milk and sit in it like I'm a magic angel. There, I said it. The white of the milk is so dense, And when I poke my little toes out from under the milk, they startle me and I giggle. I giggle, diary. They're my own toes, yet I giggle, and then I fall asleep. And the milk curdles and I get all stinky and sticky. Disgusting, diary. lam disgusting. I'm disgusting. I'm disgusting and I smell like curdled milk. Anyway, back to the Turtle Princess. Play, Beemo. So, there we are. Turtle Princess is frozen and in my little ice wheelbarrow, and there was magic in the air. We were both feeling it.  But before I can leave the library, Finn and Jake show up! You know how Jake is. Stretch this, stretch that. Bah! He knocks off my crown, and then Finn bonks me on the nose! Still hurts, too. The worst part is, Turtle Princess took away my library card.  You know, dear diary, I'm starting to worry that all these entries sound exactly the same, and that my life is just me running in place on some giant hamster wheel. Ugh, fast-forward, Beemo.  This reminds me of the time I got stuck in my bathroom. There was a squirrel. Dan 't ask. Anyway, long story short, imagine me crouched down on the kitchen Ã¯Â¬Âoor talking to the toilet paper. Ha ha! I'm like, "Who wants to go on an adventure? Ana' the toilet paper's //ke, "What?" You're my best friend, diary. I'm gonna take a nap. No! These tapes are important. We just don't know why yet. Beemo, fast-forward to triple speed. Okay-  FINN: Beemo, play normal speed.  Come on, baby, in the pocket!  I can't do it. I can't do it. Maybe he's talking in secret code. Telling evil secrets in secret code He's brilliant! Well, how do we decode the secrets? Why don't we call others for help? Beemo, you're brilliant! Well, who do we call? Um the smartest person we know -- Princess Bubblegum. She's brilliant. - Hi, Princess Bubblegum. - Hey, Finn. Jake and I found a bunch of secret tapes. We were wondering if you'd help us decode them. - Codes? - Yeah, they're really stupid, but, you know, maybe they're encoded or whatevah. Oh, you called the right person. I know a lot about codes. Let's start with --  - Huh? - Oh!  Hey, Princess, we got disconnected.  Hello, Finny.  BOTH: You sound weird. Must be a bad connection. That's why we were disconnected earlier on the telephone. Ice King is on the phone outside. So, how's the weather in Candy Kingdom? Oh, the usual. There's ice everywhere, and it smells like penguins. The only thing that smells like penguins is you, Ice King!  How did you -- What are you doing?! I want to watch secret tapes with you guys. It'll be nice. No, man. But -- He doesn't know that we're watching his tapes. We gotta find these evil secrets before he uses them against us! Ohhhh, fine! No more nice! Now you'll get ice! Try watching those tapes with frozen eyeballs!  Aaaaaaaah!    


     Yo, Beemo, you done charging up that phone, or what?  Almost finished.  JAKE: Thanks, Beemo. All right, man, we're gonna figure this out right now.  Yo, Yo, yo, yo, check it! This is Jake on my camera phone! Wh-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oa! Whoa, whoa! Yo, Finn! Say hi to my new camera phone. What up, camera phone? BOTH". BOTH : Marceline! You guys want to come party in The Nightosphere with me? I'm visiting with my dad, and it's crazy boring. Whoa! Wait a minute, Marceline. Last time I saw your dad, I sliced open his soul sack. Oh, no, he's totally chill now. Okay, but I'm keeping an eye out for your old man in case he pulls any  sneak attacks.  Don 't be a Wiener dog. Jake, you coming? Whoa! Yeah, baby!  All right, so this is The Nightosphere, I guess. It looks banaynays. Marceline says they got tons of crazy ways out here.  Right, Marceline? Marceline! Marcy! ABADEER: There you are, Marceline.  - Hmm? - Rrragh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! Oh. Hello, dog. Hello, Finn. Stay away from me, old man! Nice one. Now, Finn. Come on, there's no bad blood here. Come here. Let's bury the hatchet. See how I'm not killing you?  Dad, stop. All right. I don't want to embarrass my little girl. So, young lady, have you thought about my offer? Ugh! JAKE: What offer, Marceline's dad?  I want Marceline to take over The Nightosphere -- finally join the family business. Business? Dad, what do you even do? Oh! Ha! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Check it out, sweetie. See how chaotic it is out there?  How everyone's confused and frustrated? The Nightosphere is sustained by chaos. Eh, I just don't see myself doing this biz. Okay, but I know you'll come around eventually. Or maybe you won't. I don't know. You're an independent woman.  - Aaah! Well, I'm gonna take a nappy. Oh! I almost forgot.  ' Dad!  You should put this amulet on. It'll grant you wishes for, like, ponies -- or whatever kids like. Dad, I'm 1,000 years old. Ha! Yes, you are, sweetie. Daddy's little monster.  Look, let's just play something, okay? Okay-  I know you just wanna give your little girl the world >J' but, Daddy, I'm not just your little girl' >J' I've got my own life, I got my own plans Jâ  I hope you understand and like the way that I am 'Cause I want your respect, and I want to be here >J' but I don't want to rule The Nightosphere J"  Pffft! Whatever, dad. Ooh-- aaaaaaarrgh! - Jake, grab the amulet! Oof! - JAKE: Ow! My hippocampus! Well, that explains how we got amnesia'ed. But what about banana? Hey, man, there's another video. We got mad prison-overcrowding down here, fellas. So, I got to put you in the cage with the stuff. Sorry about that. But, you know, not really.  Oh, my stomach!  Yeeeee! That amulet's controlling Marceline! We have to go back and help her! We're gonna get back using that one portal spell we know. Hah! Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum! Whoa, dude. She told us never to come back. Oh, yeah. Oh! Jake, can you turn into a gross demon? Mm-hmm. Grosser! Raaaaaah!  What's your disguise? - Paper-plate mask, yo! - Nice!  Let's go! Hyah! Who's next? Who's next? Uh me, my lord Aberdeer. What do you desire, cowering speck -- pain, pleasure, or weird punishment? Uh pleasure? No! Weird punishment! And what do you desire -- "p," "p," or "w.p."? I pain? Okay. Aw. Come on! Come on! Next! I'm just gonna go. You sure, dude? Don't you want abs? Yeah, give me abs.  I think we can charge up there and rip the amulet off her neck. Hey! what are you guys doing?! You can't run up to the front of the line! These good people have been waiting forever! Shame on you both! Everybody, shame them!  Boo, sir! I boo what you're doing! Step back -- back! You will not cut the line again! You stay back here and wait your turn like the rest of us! Understand?! - Yeah, okay! Okay! I'll be watching you. Sorry, dude. You got out of line. Dang it! BOTH: Who are you?! Waah! Don't kill us, Marceline! It's us -- Finn and Jake! Your friends, remember?! - Eh. - FINN: Oh, grob!  Aaaaaah! Run! Marceline. What are you doing? Just grabbing a midnight snack. It's Marceline. That's her out there! I know. Isn't it fantastic? No! We have to save her! - Save her? - From the amulet! But this is what I've always wanted -- my girl following in her daddy's footsteps. But that's not what she wants! That's balderdash, baby. The wearer of the amulet is filled with chaotic evil, which is how I grew up, so  These guys won't help you. They're all complacent sheeple.  Wait. That's it! We're gonna freestyle a political rap to get these guys to rise out of their systemized demon apathy! Okay. I never thought of it that way before. This system is broke, yo!  Marceline. Ugh. Sick. - Jake! The tree house! - Aaaah! I'm too freaked out to move, Finn! These demons are nibbling my legs! Jake, take her! No, Finn! You'll be filled with chaotic evil! Aaaaah!   FINN:  Marceline. No one leaves The Nightosphere! Wh-o-o-o-oa! Oh! ABADEER: Marceline! Uh, I wonder what happened to him. Kids these days. Am I right? Dude. Seriously. Dad, you tricked me. Dad, that sucks! I know. I'm sorry. But I thought you'd want to -- want to make your old man proud and, you know, take over The Nightosphere. Yeah, I want you to be proud! I want you to be proud of me! No, I didn't mean -- baby, of course I'm proud of you. Dad. And your friends, they're all right! That political rap? Pretty great! Okay, okay. I got to go now, dad. Woof! What a nightmare. Man, Finn, my dad actually likes you. I don't want to hang out with you anymore. -  - Finn?  Come along with me And the butterflies and bees We can wander through the forest And do so as we please J"  Come along with me To a cliff under a tree Jâ 


Happy birthday! Jake? Is that you? I can't see. Right. That's because -- I'm blind! Jake, I'm blind on my birthday! No, dude, you're blindfolded. - Oh. - Keep the blindfold on. I've got a surprise for you. Surprise! Orange blindfold? That is a surprise! That's not the surprise. This is. You got me a train? Thank you, Jake! This isn't the gift. Huh? We have to take the train to get to the gift. Oh. Almost as cool as a free train. Eh. I'll go get the tickets. Okay. Hey, Mr. Conductor! It's my birthday! Oh? Climb aboard my train, little boy. You're my new friend. All aboard! This is gonna be the best birthday ever. I'm gonna go grab a schedule. Whoa! Oh, t-terribly sorry, Colonel. Oh, oh, well, that's all right. Just don't let it happen again. Sorry about that, folks. We are approaching Gumball Gulch now. The ride's gonna get a little bumpy until we reach the straightaway, so you might want to buckle up. Found a schedule. Great. Now find your seatbelt. Geez Louise. Uh, s-sorry about that, Colonel. B-Beg your pardon. Oh, sorry. Uh -- whoa! Ugh! Aah! Colonel, I am so sorry. Hey, we're in the straightaway. Ooh, I want to see. I'm gonna kill you! Aah! Aah! Aah! A skeleton. Is he going to be okay, Dr. Donut? He doesn't look good. Hey, man, this is kind of a bad scene. Maybe we should get off this train and hoof it to your surprise. Are you kidding? It's a murder mystery on a train, and we're gonna solve it. All right. What do you think, Dr. Donut? Any clues? Hmm. I think it was the guy who screamed, "I'm gonna kill you." Uh, no, no, it -- it -- it wasn't me. I swear! Passengers, passengers, I don't think it was Colonel Candycorn. Oh, well, well, thank you. No, in murder mysteries, it's never the first person you think of -- never, ever. So, who do you think it is? Colonel, do you have any enemies on this train? Well, uh -- well, just one. And his or her name is -- See? I knew it wasn't him. But now we have to figure out who his enemy is. It could be anybody. It could even be you. Yes, it could, except I didn't do it. But we don't know that. You singled me out to take suspicion off yourself. Are you Colonel Candycorn's enemy? What? No. I was just trying to join in on the conversation. Suspect numero uno! Rat traps. I really thought I was on to something. Now, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but what about the conductor? No, it's definitely not him. Aw. Why not? Because he's weird and creepy, and you never suspect the creepy guy because it's too obvious. Whatever, man. I'm gonna go sit and look at the schedule. We're running out of suspects. And we're running out of time. Attention. Attention, passengers. Gnarly. Yeah. Hi. It's me -- the conductor. Anyway, I couldn't help overhearing that someone here thinks I'm weird and creepy. And, you know, I'm not weird and creepy. I'm cool and awesome. Happy birthday, Finn. Hey, Jake? Yeah? The conductor was just here, and he was weirder and creepier than before. What?! No way. He was cool and awesome. Anyway, it's still not him. No, the murderer is right here among us. Isn't that right, doctor? You think it was me? When Candycane guy was murdered, you diverted suspicion towards Colonel Candycorn, then killed him to protect your alibi. Are you kidding? Dude, I think you're way off. Am I? Or am I way on? Son of a -- My hunches aren't getting me anywhere. The killer is laughing at us, Jake. What do you think we should do? Hmm. We need hard evidence. Ha! A basket of eggs, fish, and cabbage. It's a receipt from an earlier train ride, from another train. Jake, I found a book. It's a dictionary. It's sheet music! It doesn't make any sense to me. Me neither. Maybe the murderer is just too smart for us. Yes! Jake, that's it. It's all so clear now. Gather everyone in the caboose, and I will reveal a murderer. You're the only remaining passengers, so the murderer is in this caboose. Let me explain how I know who the murderer is. I saw Pineapple Guy skim through the sheet music, sheet music to a song that's very special to Lollipop Girl, a song that reminds her of Ice Cream Guy. Before Colonel Candycorn died, Dr. Ice Cream was in possession of a basket of cabbage, fish, and eggs. And you, Pineapple Guy, have cabbage bits on your socks. And you, Chocolate Bar Guy -- does this dictionary look familiar, a dictionary which happens to contain the words "rid," "guests," "at once." But the real murderer is someone no one suspects. The real murderer is No one was the murderer? The conductor's still on the train. Oh, yeah. He did it. Yay! You did it! You solved it, Finn! I knew it -- because he's creepy. What?! Hmph. I know -- you knew he was the murderer all along. I couldn't have done it without you, you, you, you. Thank you. We make a great team, pal. You feel kind of bony. Aah! Jake? No! Hey. How could you murder all those candy people? And you murdered Jake on my birthday! Yes, and you're next. Wrong. Grr! Hunh! Unh! Mnh! No!! Ah! Unh! I'm coming for you! Unh! Ugh! This is for Jake! Hunh! Unh! Hyah! You're going down, or both of us are going down. My birthday wish is vengeance! Happy birthday to me! Wait! Y-You're alive! You were the conductor the whole time? Yep. You were so busy focused on the murders that you never even noticed. The skeletons were the hardest part. Aah! Aah! Aah! It was all an elaborate setup for your birthday present. So nobody was murdered? Nope, not unless you count the train's control panel. Aah! Aah! Aah! Dude, open your eyes. Hey, we're alive! to you  Wow. This is the best birthday ever. Thanks, Jake. You deserve it, buddy, 'cause you're a great friend. I think my favorite part was landing on the gelatin. That must have taken forever to plan. Nope. That part was a total accident. Oh. So we could have -- - Died horribly? Yes. Happy birthday, pal!


      Finn! Jake! I invited some bikini babes over to dance to this song. feel a thousand petals I'm walking by cherry blossoms in the sky  It's my favorite song! It makes me so happy!  Uh, why are you not talking?  There's so much to take in  What?  Today I'm humming like washing machines through the window And feeling glad  Why are you not talking?! What happened to Finn and Jake?! You have taken over their bodies!   Oh, what should I do? Oh! Oh!  Feel so friendly when you say BMO? I'm looking forward to         Aah! Go away! Where is the real Jake?! You're a doppelganger, you! Body taker! Aaah! Suddenly, I'm  BMO? BMO, are you at home? BMO, we're here to dance with you!    Aah!   Yeah.   I'm looking forward to the chance to meet again But, then again, it all depends  BMO: No way, fake boys! I am never coming out! BMO: Bikini babes! They are not Finn and Jake! Get them!  Ow! Ow! Okay, fine! Uncle! Uncle! Please stop pinching me, bikini babe! Oh, I win!  You're so disappointed.  Finn? Jake? For real? We were just playing a game, BMO. It all started this morning when Jake made a sign that said Oh, I don't care. Let's just party!  Party, party, party! Oh, yeah.    


  Hey this is nuts, right? Look, I've got both my teeth! Look! I lost one in a box turtle once. Also, I used to be dead. Ah! Mmf! Mm mm! Mmm!! Mmwah!! Pwah! Fool, this is life. Get a hot dog if you can't take the bun. Pah! It tastes different here! Where are we? It's like we fell asleep on a raft and woke up in strange seas. Humph! Fell asleep? We died. The demon Marceline staked us all. Why are we back? How did it happen? Listen I dunno know and I don't care. We're alive and I'm going to get eating! Ugh. Aaah Does anyone have any milk for this? Do you, like, carry milk? Moo! Moo? This is well and good for you, Hierophant. All you ever needed was a forest and something hot to chew on. Where are the comforts of the old hive? The minions The blood The good blood, with the gold leaf flaked into it. The gold leaf was stupid. It didn't taste like anything. We had standards! It doesn't matter when we are or where we are because we are. We must start rebuilding our realm. There's life here and I bet it's pathetic. We march in, we take control, and we rebuild the hive! My King, are you listening? The Fool: I dunno. Like What if we just got a loft downtown? Whoops, I'm hypnotized. Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh! Good old "backwards egg!" Ugh. Ugh! I don't like to dance. I'm a wallflower. Oh! Ugh! Hierophant: My King Surely you agree that this is our chance to go back to our old ways. Surely diverging from the old ways is what made us vulnerable the first time! Surely whoaaaa! Surely?! Surely? Surely J. Temple! Oh! I am your king, and I say it's a new era! Old-fashioned ideas have no place here. Do what you like! I know what's right! If you are going to caterwaul like this, Then I may, as well, start building my army. Hasta luego, turds. Oh, getting' dizzy You sure the sun's not hurting you at all? No, this is great. I can even feel my skin aging. Huff! Cow Teeth and Shirley temple Aaaaaaah! I ran into some vampires! They were being weird as crabs! Do you know these oily doilies, Marceline? What?! No! I'm cured! It is weird though that it's happening at about the same time I got un-gunked. I gotta go see Bonnie. Ow! Oh yeah, guess I'm walkin'. No mo' powers. Didn't your daddy give you demon powers? My Dad never gave me squat! Well, just some soul-sucking skills. Remember this? Aah! My soul! Ugh, even though I got my soul sucked, I'll still give you a ride to Bonnie's because I'm good. Bonnie, I don't get it. Jake's talking about vamps at the same time you fixed me, and there can't be any still around! Well, clearly something's creeping around. Okay, what about the paste you took out of me? That should be all that is left that's vampiric in the modern world. It's all over there, safely in the safety bucket. What?! Pep But, what'd you do with the gunk?! Hold on, I'm working. Okay. There was one that looked like if a baby-snake was a baby-baby. Nah, that's not right. There was another one that looked like if an ant hill were a girl. Nah, that's not right. There's one of them that looked like a wet uncle. Nah, that's not right. There was a lady who looked like black drapes on a cake pop. Nah, that's not right. There was also one that looked like an angry stop sign coming out of a loaf of bread. Nah, that's not oh, actually that one's pretty close. What?! Vampire King: You can stop this now, Marceline, it's not too late. You've got power now. I see it. But you haven't paid a price. It's making you crazy. Marceline, there's no one left but me. Would you wipe out an entire species? For the last time, yes! That is literally my entire plan! So be it then. Uh Duh. I gave you a chance, Marcel Blah, blah, blah, blah! You know, Marceline, there's still another way. Give it a rest already! No another 'nother way To save my people. Wait! Noooo! This is really bad. These guys They're heavy hitters. If they get back to full strength, they'll tear this world apart. What's the plan, Marceline? How do we fight them? Peppermint Butler:  If I may Strong enough for an ultravampire But made for a vampire. Wow. Look, Jake, a two-pronged stake And a stake boomerang. Yes, and what's this behind your ear? A super garlic bomb! Bubblegum: What the heck, Peps? Why do you have all this vampire junk lying around? I have these high-tech weapons painstakingly stockpiled in case a certain frenemy of yours decides to turn on us someday. - Peps! - No no, he's right. I could've snapped and done you all in at any time. Ugh! The cave is totally empty. No sign of anyone. Phew! Nothing going on out here either. Maybe we should all fan out Look for tracks. Or clues. All right. But everyone be careful. Even in their mushy state, these guys'll crack up ya sacrum. Jake: Gross. Don't worry about us, Marceline. Yeah, we're ready for anything. Can't smell nuthin' no more. Ugh! Ahh. Crud. Whoops. Oh no, my bomb! Hey guys, why don't y'all head back to the cabin? I'm gonna try to put together a profile, you know Forensically. Okay, Marceline, sounds good. Come on, boys, let's get you cleaned up. I know you're in there, you skunk. You butt. You stain. You Hey. Long time no see. Indeed. Hey! Marceline! Look at me! I'm all grown up now! I ate a chicken, Marceline. I see you're getting your strength back. Yes, not long now. - Well don't get your hopes up. - Pbht! Pbht! Things are different now. The humans are long gone. Someone's smelling a bit human herself these days. Anyway, you don't need to worry, I've changed, as well. I only eat animals now. Just like everyone else. Ugh. Huh? Does that mean we can be friends now, Marceline? It doesn't matter how you pretend to change. You've done enough already to get staked a thousand times over. You're monsters. You'll always be Smell my feet, Marceline. I promise you won't regret it. Oooh! Ohhhh Your loss. You know, the others won't be so easy, Marceline. Well how 'bout you? It doesn't have to be like this. Those are some pretty frou-frou last words. You've lost a step! I'm not even gonna need my powers. I'm surprised, Marceline. What now? Surprised you have the time to play around while the empress makes her way to the land of ice and snow. Simon. Crud!

Yeah, I've been here singing from the very beginning of Ooo.  Since I can't move from this spot,  singing is my only outlet.  I can neither participate in joy nor prevent disaster,  so I sing.  Is this like one of those patterns  that's supposed to have a 3-D image in it,  and everyone can see it except you?  Well, why can't they hear you?  MUSIC HOLE: Only two kinds of people can hear my song,  those who see the world with pure, childlike wonder  and those with a deep sense of loss in their hearts.

     Tickle, tickle, tickle! Wakey, wakey, wake!  Yoo yoo yoo yoo yoo yoo Wow. That was really something. Really something. - Sure, I'll hold. - Thank you for your time. Hello? I'd like to take a few minutes of your time to tell you about an amazing vitamin supplement. But first, just let me ask you, do you ever feel that no matter what you eat, you're still tired and sluggish and  Filled with nagging anxiety and doubt and --  Root Beer Guy, get your head back in the game! Hello, ma'am. I'd like to take a few minutes of your time --  Hello? What we need is to cut out the middle man. - Hey, Root Beer Guy. - Hey. Dude, we should start our own place. Next stop, Lollipop Park Estates.  This is good. What is this? Candy. Hmm.  Oh, I've got a closing argument tomorrow, Root Beer Guy.  I knew there was trouble,. I could smell it on the hot evening breeze. Fortunately for me, trouble is my favorite thing because I'm Joe Milkshake. I kicked down the door with one swift, decisive motion. No. With one swift and decisive motion, I kicked down the door. No. "The door was kicked down by me swiftly with not many motions but a whole lot of decisiveness was used by me that was apparent to everybody." Ugh.  BUBBLEGUM: Aaaaaaaaaah! Hmm. BUBBLEGUM: What are you doing?!  Let me go! No! BOTH: Yeah!  - Hey. Hey, are you awake? - Not really. Well, this is gonna sound crazy, but I think I saw Princess Bubblegum get kidnapped, and the perpetrators were that Finn and Jake. Okay, sweetie. That sounds like an interesting dream.  - But it did happen.  You need to eat something before you go to work, and you can't keep falling asleep at your typewriter. It's bad for your back. Besides, I miss you at night. I'm sorry, sweetie. I couldn't stop thinking about that weird stuff I saw last night when I was peeking through the bushes. Ugh! Peeking through the bushes?! You've been warping your mind with all this mystery stuff. I swear, sometimes I think you love that novel of yours more than you love me. You've been working on it every night for 10 years, and for what?! Look at me, Root Beer Guy! I'm a cherry cream soda, and I have the same needs as any other cherry cream soda or even diet cream soda!  I didn't know what to say, but Joe Milkshake never was a talky guy. On my way to work that morning, I decided to lake a second look at the crime scene. Hmm.  Lake Butterscotch? Hmm. MAN: Root Beer Guy! Root Beer Guy! Root Beer Guy! How many bottles of product you sell this month? Zero. Great! Least you can count to zero! You know, maybe if you'd give me the new leads You haven't earned the new leads. It's easy to do when you have all the leads. - Exactly. - Hey, Root Beer Guy. It's all about the leads. See? I told you! It's candy stucco. Stucco feels great. Hmm. When you're right, you're right. All right, you two. What were you doing last night with Princess Bubblegum? - Uh - Hmm We were home last night. - Yeah. We were doing that thing. That was a great thing we were doing at home with no other witnesses. But we're each other's witnesses. - BOTH: Yeah! - But I saw you. Look, man, you didn't see nothin'. Hmph!  Mr. Banana Guard, you've got to arrest those guys! Come on! These are the guys! They're kidnappers! You have to arrest them and find out where they're hiding Princess Bubblegum. Princess Bubblegum? She's right around the corner! Oh, Princess Bubblegum!  Yes?  I think some banana guards wish to speak with you.  Where are those banana guards? - Your highness! - ALL: Greetings, your majesty! Your skin is looking lovely today. Oh, thanks! It's really, really orange! Ugh! I've been using this new, uh, marmalade spray-on tan. Yeah. Cinnamon Bun  Bingo-bango. This was my lucky break. With one decisive motion, I kicked down the door. So, uh, being tan is my thing now. Quickly, I scanned the room for the -- Oh, man. "Caramel Court," "Cotton Candy Crescent." "Lollipop Park Estates" -- Bingo-bang-- Aha! Huh? Bingo-bango.  Bonsoir, monsieur.  Would you like me to turn down the bed? Uh, look what I've got. The security tape will show that Finn and Jake kidnapped Princess Bubblegum.  Finn and Jake would never do that! Oh, yeah? Prepare to have your mind blown after I put this tape in the VCR, just to make sure I got the right one. I'm pretty sure I did!  Hey, yes! This is it! - Aaaaaaaaaah! - Bingo-bango! I've got to get to the -- Are you in the tub, sweetie? I'm going out! I've got to get this tape to the banana guards or the newspaper or maybe the D.A. or something.  Hey, Root Beer Guy. You were not supposed to view this tape. But -- but how did you guys know'? I told them. That's right. I did it for us! Oh, this thing is eating you alive, Root Beer Guy! But it's all I've got.  Hey, this looks kind of personal. Hmph.  Mr. Pudding -- Oh, you can just call me "Buck." Uh, Buck, those -- No need to be formal here, son. Those guys who were just in here -- can you tell me what they bought? Well, let's see -- a shovel, a saw, some plastic bags, some duct tape, a bludgeon, a mop, rubber gloves. Say, Mr. -- Buck, do you know anything about this Lake Butterscotch? Right nice spot, Lake Butterscotch -- miles from where anyone could hear a person scream, if a person were screaming for some reason. Creepy now that I think about it. Nothing up there these days but some abandoned cabins. Nice place to hide a body if you were into that sort of thing. Son, now, what are you doing in my pickup truck'?   - Yeah? - Don't hang up! I'm Root Beer Guy. I'm the guy who kidnapped Princess Bubblegum. Yeah, yeah. I wrapped her in a carpet -- yeah -- and I'm gonna dump her in Lake Butterscotch! I'm completely insane!  But you still have time to stop me. Get up to Lake Butterscotch right now, Banana Guard.  And I took a boat out after 8:00. Emergency! Quickly, to Lake Butterscotch! - ALL: Wee-ooo! Wee--  ALL: Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Ugh! ALL: Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Use the licorice lace lasso!  Whoa! Oh, my word! Get those guys! They're my accomplices! - Oh. Okay. - I got it!  Busted, you boat crimer.  It's Finn and Jake?! Well, guys it looks like you caught us. Okay, Princess. You can come out now.  Princess! Oh, yeah. It is the princess.  Congratulations! Whee! Whee! You were so good at solving the case. Um, what case'? The fake kidnapping. To test the Candy Kingdom's security system? We didn't solve that case. But if you weren't following the clues I left, who was? Um it's Root Beer Guy. Then why the Jumping Jay is he in handcuffs?! Uh, he went boating.  ROOT BEER GUY:  Boo-ba-dee-bee Dee-ba dee-ba doo doo Doo doo doo-doo-doo doo dee  That was a great night, baby. We haven't danced like that in years. I'm so proud of you, Mr. Captain of the Banana Guards.   This party is so crazy!


      You're totally slow, dude. Speed up them gams.  l'm not used to running on all fours! Aah! Ready to admit it's harder than it looks? l'll never admit anything to you. Hey! Where'd you go?  Whoa! Ugh! Okay, l admit, it's -- it's harder than l thought.  Actually, you did pretty good. Hey, check it out. - Whoa! Looks like a giant dead turtle. l think it's some kind of city of Thieves! lt's the city of thieves! Be warned, boy! All who enter the city are destined to become thieves themselves.  Even you! l wouldn't become a thief, lady! l'm a pretty good guy. Yeah, get your glasses on, grandma. This kid is pure. ln fact, he's about to help that little crying kid. - Oh, whoa! - Be warned! Enough, lady! Hey, little girl, are you okay? Please, don't steal anything from me! Whoa! We wouldn't do that. We're heroes. We wanna turn your frown all the way around. Aah!  - Jake! - l'll face the other way but l'm gonna keep doing this. So, what's wrong? Oh, it was terrible. l was trying to sell my flowers out here in the desert when these two thieves came and stole my whole basket, then ran into the city. - The city? - Of thieves! Oh, boy. Heed my warning, boy! Enter the city, and you'll come out a thief! Never! l'll get this girl's flowers back. My name's Penny. l'll get Penny's flowers back and come out of that city as pure as the driven snow. Let's go, Jake! Yeah! We're gonna purify that city! - Cool! - Crud. My ring!  Stop, thief! - Rrr! - Aah! Stop! My ruby! Stop, baby! Don't steal!  Don't steal, Mr. Turtle. Finn, it's hopeless to try stopping a thief here. Everyone steals from each other. lt's ri-doo-doo-diculous! Penny! Never say that! 'Cause l'm gonna get your basket back from whoever took it, and then l'm going to beat my purity into them! And then l'm gonna beat your purity out of them and then beat a sandwich into them.  And then beat them to the punch! And then punch them! - We can beat these thieves while we search for Penny's flower basket. Okay! Yah! Hey, ''Turd-le.'' l'm gonna kick your butt! Also, have you seen this little girl's flower basket? You're going down, Turtle! Whoa. l want jets. Yah! Come back, crossbow guy! Ha ha! My crossbow! Hey! My basket! That's my basket! Don't worry, Penny. We'll get it right after l deal with thls guy. Stealing's wrong, doofus!  This is fun, Finn! Whoo!  - Poodaw! - My bro! My body! l'm gonna steal your flower basket, wizard! Pancake, pancake, pancake. Meow!  - Whoa, brother! - Yah! My glasses.  My jammies! My glasses! Ow! - There it goes!  l will smite thee, goblin thief! You stole that basket from me. No, l didn't. Hey! Gimme that! l stole it first! l'll use my sword on you. Hey! You, there! lt's time to step inside the purification chamber, son. Hey!  Huh?  How are we supposed to get that basket back if it keeps being stolen?! Ugh! Hey! We can steal a new one from that guy. He's got lots of flower baskets and boots. l'd like to steal me one of them pairs of boots, especially. No, Jake. We can't steal. We have to stay pure. O-kay. l have an idea. My mom used to tell me that there's a king of thieves who lives in the center of the city, and everything that gets stolen from little girls ends up at his tower. Maybe we'd find my basket in his treasure chest. That's a great idea, Penny. There's one thing, though. The tower that he lives in is surrounded by a magical barrier which magically keeps thieves out. Have you forgotten? We three ain't thieves. We're pure! Right, Jake? Jake? Just gotta steal these boots. - Jake! - Huh? - Hey, go away! - What are you doing, man? lt's the city! lt's getting to me! Help me, Finn! - l'm here for you, buddy. Thank you, Finn. Thank you. Rah! No! l won't let you become a thief! Uh, what are these? Bells. That way, l'll hear if you try to steal again. Oh! Hmm.  The king of thieves' tower is right up here.  Whoa! You ready to pass through, Penny? l'm too afraid. ls it okay if l wait out here? Sure. Come on, let's go, Jake!  Coming. Jake, where'd you get those boots? Huh? What? What boots? Oh, no! l stole! The city -- it took advantage of me! Ugh! Jake, you're a thief now. You won't be able to get in anymore. Yes, l can. Oof! Oh. Heh!  lt's up to me now. Legend says you'll find the loot in the king of thieves' chest. Good luck, Finn. Oh, yeah, and that high window is the only entrance. Hmm. All right, wish me luck. - She already did, man. - Oh, yeah. Right.  Whoo! Yeah, Finn! Ugh! Great, now l gotta climb down? Huh?  Whoa! The king of thieves. Uh sorry to trespass. l just, uh Hello? The chest! lt's ln his chest. Thanks.  Aah! You see, if you have too much earwax, you won't be able to hear anymore. - l got it, guys! - The chest! Gimme that! - Huh?! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, kid.  Wha?! l-ls your basket under all that gold? Of course it's not! l set you up to steal this chest of gold! l couldn't get past the barrier 'cause l'm a thief! But you're just a cute little girl! And l'm a thief! Well, if this isn't yours, l'm gonna return it right now! Huh? Why can't l You stole something in the city. Now you're a thief! No. No-o-o-o! What have l done?! What have l become?! You've become a thief, stupid.  My hands, they're all dirty, covered in the dust of a criminal act. l'm a thief!  Huh? Whoa! Ugh! Ooh, what did l tell you, boy? This city will get to you, no matter how pure you think you are!  l was right. Hey! That's enough from you, hag! Aah! Hey! Finn? Don't touch me! l'm impure, man! Unfit to be a hero. Unfit to be your friend. Come on, Finn. Keep it together. No, Jake. This is a one-way path down a jacked-up road, and l got to walk it alone. l'm not gonna leave you alone in this city. You're my buddy. Besides, l stole these boots. These super-babe-style boots. So l'm just as dirty as you are, Finn. We got to walk this filthy path together. Then we shall embrace the darkness of this wicked city and use the methods of the criminal to seek vengeance on Penny. Cowabunga! Cowabunga, indeed.  Yah!  PENNY: Mm. Yes. Yeah. Wha?! ls someone there? Hmm. Heh. - Penny. - Huh? lt's me, Penny -- the hero whose purity you stole. And l'm here to enact my revenge upon you. Aah! Hi, Penny. Finn, please don't punch my lights out. l'm just a poor homeless baby girl! l trusted you, Penny. You made me steal. And you took my purity. You ruined me! l'm sorry, Finn! Let me give you some, uh, gems or some gold. Or, uh, have some knife in your neck! - Watch out, Finn! - Aah! Oof! Ow! Ugh! - Thanks, dude. - Yeah, dude. You may have soiled my purity, but l think you can still come out clean. Come on, Jake!  No! No!  Nice work, dude. FlNN: She's purified. l feel clean, like all the filth of the city and wrongdoings are gone. Thank you, ''F'' and ''J.'' l haven't felt like this since l was young! You're welcome! Whoa, dude! The soap got on us, too. We're clean! BOTH: Yes! This good deed we did has purified us once again. We're virgin islands! Finn, thank you for this second chance to live a purer life. And you know what that means, Penny. No more stealing. - Never again. Well, l think it's time for us to get the math out of here. l'm going to miss you, Finn! - l'll miss you, too. - Goodbye. Whoa, dude. - Why are you naked? - Aah! Penny!  


     Faster! She's in danger! Who is he talking about? I have no idea. What?! Then why am I running so hard? Because Because she's in trouble! BOTH: Who is? Marceline! Faster, Jake! She's in trouble! Hey, wizard, how do you know Marceline? I'm her spirit animal. Oh.  Marceline! What's wrong with her?! She accidentally cast a sleep spell on herself, and now she's trapped in eternal slumber. Tell us how to break the spell. I'll transport you into Marceline's mind, where you will walk through her memories and find the memory core. Then what? Find the memory of Marceline casting the sleep spell on herself. At your touch, you and the memory will be transported back to reality. But, like, if you know all this, why not just do it yourself? Entering a person's mind can be dangerous, and I don't have any arms -- just legs.  Oh, yeah. Here we go. Ungh! What? What did you do to my forehead? When you get close to the memory, your forehead will glow. Here. Take this. WIZARD: It's a sack of magic powder. Sit on the couch and sprinkle the powder on your head. Like this? Yep. Like that. Feel sleepy?  BOTH: Mm-hmm. Good. Sleep now. But know this! - BOTH: Huh?! If you fail, Marceline will be trapped in eternal sleep forever!  And ever! And ever!  Did it work? I-I can't tell. I don't feel like I'm inside Marceline's memories. Me neither. Huh?  Whoa! Whoa! So if we're in Marceline's memories, where's Marceline? Hmm. There she is! Hey, Li'l Marcy. Who are you guys? - We're Finn and Jake. - We're your friends. Hambo is my only friend. See? You need another eyeball surgery, pal. Lucky for you, we found a donor. Eyeball! Nurse, hand me the string. Yes, doctor. It's our last piece. Hold still. I'm hurting you because I love you.  What are you guys still doing here? We're trying to wake you up. Do you know where your memory core is? Nope. But there might be anything behind that cellar door. And it rhymes with "memory core." Ooh! Ooh! Could be jams and pickles down there! Weird. I think this door leads to a new memory with food in it. Ooh! Ice cream! I want some! Huh?  Come on, Finn.  Yo, man. Wha?! Don't eat those. Bluh! Marceline!  Daddy? Why? Hmm. - What? It's our tree house. This must be when Marceline lived here.  Easy. Easy. You got it? Yeah. Aah!  I'm so glad we're doing this, Ash. Yeah, me too. Oh, hey. Wait. Watch this. I've been practicing.  Marceween! I wuv! I wuv! Oh, Ash. Who's this guy supposed to be? Ash, I guess.  This place reeks. Yo, man. Your thing is glowing. My what? Oh, my thing. We must be close to the core. I see another door over there. Come on. Wait a sec, Jake. It's that guy again. ASH: Hey. O-Open your eyes. Look at this, Mar-Mar. Check it out. It's my new wand. These cherry blossoms -- look. Look as close as you can, and they're real.  Wow. Awesome. Where'd you get the money for that thing? Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much to a witch. You what?! Are you crazy?! That was my favorite thing in the whole world! That's why it's so valuable, genius -- for potions. You're not a genius. You're not a genius. That's the last straw, Ash! That's it!  You're a psycho jerk, and you've ruined my life! But -- but not all of it! It's over, you psycho!  JAKE: This way, Finn! Check out this whacked-out memory crack! It's banaenae down here!  FINN: The core! JAKE: All these orbs must be her memories! - How are we supposed to know which one to grab? - Play "hot/cold" with your forehead. - All right. Hot or cold? - Cold. Definitely cold.  Warmer. Hyup! Ungh! Warmer. Warmer! Whoa! Hot! Hot, hot, hot! That must be the one!  Wha? Hey! You have arms! That's right, genius. Huh? You lied to us! Ah, the important thing is Marceline's awake. Marcy! Marcy! You're okay! Quit touching my hair! You had a magic accident, and we saved you with some help from your wizard friend. That's Ash. BOTH: Ash?! He's not my friend. He's my boyfriend! BOTH: What?! That's right, babe. Ash, what's going on? Just picking up my girl for a night on the town at my place.  Aw, that's sweet.  BOTH: What?! Oh, grow up, you guys. I'm gonna go freshen up. That's a relief.  Oh, Ash. Wha-a-a-a-t?! Don't you guys get it? I out-brained you. That wasn't the memory of a sleep spell you brought me. That memory was our breakup! It's over, you psycho!  That's enough of that. Oh, no! What?! Yup. Come on, Mar-Mar. Let's go. No! Marceline! Ashicus flyicus. They're gone, man! He took her! Don't worry, Finn! I got the scent! Follow me. This is it? I can smell 'em in there. So, what's the plan? Um okay, you take that shovel and keep banging it against that shed till Ash comes out to see what's happening. Then I'll sneak in, and I'll rescue Marceline. Nice. Aah! My house! What's happening?! Wha? No! Don't hurt me! No! No, sorry! Ju--  Shh! Shh! Wait! Aah! Help! Somebody help me!  What's all this hullabaloo?! Help! Help! Hey, hold it! You! Get back here! Oof!  Finn? Finn, what are you doing? You can't be here. Ash doesn't like me hanging out with mere mortals. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, Marceline. I'll go. I've just got to show you something first. Pbtbtbtbtbtbtbt!  Hello? Finn? BABY FINN:  I'm a buff baby that can dance like a man I can shake-ah my fanny I can shake-ah my can I'm a tough-tootin' baby I can punch-ah your buns punch-ah your buns I can punch all your buns if you're an evil witch I will punch you for fun  Hey, there you are. Finn, what's going on? What is this place? It's my old house. That magic powder put you in my memories. Me and Jake were in yours before, but Ash tricked us into stealing your memory of breaking up with him. But it's okay, 'cause I saw the missing memory. Now I have a memory of your memory in my memory. See? Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you loved so much to a witch. It's over, you psycho! Finn, I think I'd like to wake up now. You gonna be okay, Marceline? Yeah. Thanks, Finn, I just -- Yo, Mar-Mar. What's -- what's with the chump? Come on, I said "no chumps." Ash gets hungies at 8:00. You need to get back in the kitchen and make me dinner.  I want a turkey sandwich with tomato.  Also pickles. Aah! Oh, my -- oh!  Oh, this is --  I can't see!     


-  -  -  -   -  -  Brr! It's freezing in here! Whoa! I'm losing a lot of weight! Calorie control and moderate exercise are the key. But I don't do any of those things, so this is weird. Hmm. -  - What is the wind chill factor? My jets are tiny. No one look at my tiny jets! At least your body's normal, man. My body isn't hot anymore! What's going on, man?! I'm scared! Give me a hug, man. I don't know! Aaah! No! My baby bro! It's as I feared. The magma in the kingdom's core is cooling down, weakening the lifeforce of our flame citizens. I've gathered you here to figure out how to stop this. We need ideas, people! I'll do my best, sis. Randy, you are here to stay safe only. Eat your snacks. I'll do my best, sis. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum! Perhaps everyone can form into a big love hug to stay warm. That's ridiculous, Aunt Agnes. I'm not that smart. Blow up the candy kingdom! I've been saying this for months now, and I'll say it again! Let's blow 'em up with our stockpile of "you-know-whats"! We've debated this too long. But why the candy kingdom? Their sugar burns hotter and faster with lots of extra calories. Don't make me wait, sister! Also, is this safe to talk about in front of the - c-i-n-n-a-m-o-n b-u-n? -  Cinnamon bun, what are you doing? My nose itches!  - You don't have a nose. - What? Ugh! Well, whatever it is, it won't go away if you don't stop fiddling with it. Blow up the candy kingdom! They are trash people! I'm prepared to do what I need to as a leader. Nothing is off the table. But we need Princess Bubblegum as an ally right now. She might be able to help us solve this. Very well! Randy, send them an ultimatum - help us or die! - Randy is on it! -  - Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! -  - Princess! - Yeah! Pump those legs, Randy! -  Quickly, C.B. Take me to the core entrance. Okay. Hello, Bubblegum. Thank you for coming. Bubblegum: I'm glad you sent for me, and, please, call me Bonnibel. - Hey, what's your first - Don't act like you're my friend, PB. You're here to help save my kingdom, - not because I trust you. - We're in the midst of an unnatural cold season, but the cause has us stumped. My people are really freaking out. Bubblegum: Yeah, my subjects tend to panic in crisis situations, too. It's tough. A ruler's got to deal with a lot of subservient dummies. Hmm.  Bubblegum: Whoa, whoa! Hold up! - My mondometer is going cuckoo! -  Where does this lead? Behind these doors are the most sacred relics in the fire kingdom, forbidden to outsiders. Come on. Bubblegum: Well, whatever is back there is kicking out mondo energy levels. It could have something to do with the cooling. -  - Both: Whoa! Bubblegum: Do you want to save your kingdom or not? All right, but don't touch anything. These are the sleeping fire giants. They're the ancient protectors of the fire kingdom. Their existence is known only to those of the royal line, and their story has been passed down through the generations.  There was a time before when we were still afraid of the dark then came the first spark a fiery birth it totally rocked sentinels crashing down out of the blue creating a kingdom of red hue now there's only few these sleeping gods of tremendous power can cause a new kingdom to flower so burn as bright as the sun, my fiery one if lights start to dim, awaken again the slumbering ones  With them, I can remake a white-hot new fire kingdom. They're our last resort our greatest weapons. -  - Huh? Hey! I said, "no touching!" Bubblegum: What? Oh, no, no, no. This little thermic control module or whatever it is accidentally fell out. I was just putting it back. Huh. Strange. The access panel's lock must have corroded. Bubblegum: Yeah. Ancient technology's always falling apart.  Oh, the readings are over here now.  What?! Bubblegum: Okay, let me explain. These bad boys are just too dangerous to remain functional, and I can't risk you or your bananas brother using them, especially now that you've lost most of your powers. - So let me just finish disarming -  You are way out of line, Bubblegum! You have no control here! I do!  Bubblegum: Aah! Ugh! Shield! Shield! Whoa! Bubblegum: Hey, nice shot, you ding-dong! -  - Bubblegum:  Come out in the open and face me like a princess! Bubblegum: The fire kingdom has always been a threat to my realm! So, that gives you the right  to donk up my people's future?! I won't let you continue to usurp my authority! Bubblegum: And I can't leave my people's safety to chance! - Why can't you just trust me?! - Bubblegum:  'Cause you're a ding-dong. I've got to do whatever it takes to protect my peeps. So be it. Bubblegum: Whoa!  You're never going to change, are you? You'll just keep walking all over us little people. - But not today. - Bubblegum:  -  -  Aaah! Aaah!  -  - Bubblegum:  Shields off. -  - Okay. - I'll come clean. - Yeah, right. Bubblegum: It was me. I messed with the core temperature to get in here. I had to get near your weapons stockpile. But how did you find out about them? Bubblegum: Um Wait! - Oh-ho-ho! Oh-ho-ho! - Wow! My nose is disgusting! You're still spying on me?! Bubblegum: I'm PB. I spy on everybody. No big "D." - You're cold, PB. - Bubblegum: Eh. And it's not because you're a scientist or a leader. It's because you are a bad person. Something inside you is messed up, girl, and whatever it is  Whatever. Whatever, PB. Bubblegum: Okay. Keep one last fire giant. I'm not a bad person. I want you to see that. I promise. You'd better not be fibbin'. It's Phoebe. My first name is Phoebe. You, uh, asked earlier. Bubblegum: Ice King, call it off. Roger that, Princess. My jets! Yes! Oh, no!  I was gonna blow up stuff! It was gonna be cool! Bubblegum: Hmm.  We were going to war! Both:  round and round as nature flows it's like one big ring  _


    Okay, now make him look angrier. FINN: All right, give me a second JAKE: Nope. Not funny anymore. Sorry, dude. You ruined it. Man, I don't have the patience for this animation junk. Whoever does this must have no life whatsoev-- Oof! Why did I do that?  BOTH: Huh? Yo, Finn, did you order a brick? Mm, I don't think so. JAKE: False alarm. It's just an e-mail. FINN: Who's it from? Looks like Ice King's handwriting. FINN: Ugh! JAKE: Ohh! Escape,Jake! Escape! All right, all right, hold on. I think I can  Aw, man. Thing must've had a computer worm in it. Whaaaa?  Hi, Princess! What now, Ice King? Remember that time last summer when you said you'd only go out on a date with me if I was the last guy on Ooo? I doubt I said that.  BOTH: P-Bubs! P-Bubs! P-Bubs!  - The computer went - Open video and - the e-mail - potato trampoline brick window with the plastic banana hummingbird Ahem. Anyone having any  computer prob/ems?  How do we stop that computer worm, you Pile of goo!  My worm exists beyond your comprehension, within the universal source code. Stop talkin' like a nerd and give it to us straight! Once the glitch does its work, the whole world will be deleted, except for me and my Bubblygums.  Mwah! Mwah, mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Ow!  Well, see you all. I'm gonna prepare for my date. Whee-ha-haw!  Aaah! My beautiful face! My hopes and dreams ruined!  Don't worry, Princess. We'll take care of this thing. Oh, me, too. I'm gonna take care of it, too. Okay!  Don't worry, guy! iI got you! Yee-aah! Jake, help me! Okay, shh. You're safe. Come here, guy. No, get away from me! I'm trying to help you, yo! I saw what happened when you picked up Todd. But nooooo! Jake, this isn't working! We need a plan. Oh, man! Okay, here's my dream plan. You were wearing tights made of green feathers -- these tiny green feathers. And I was this wise-cracking coelacanth that only ate popcorn. Anyway, we were in this -- That plan's not good! Hold on. I'm almost done. So, we were trapped inside this huge egg, and after a while, you started dancing in this kind of sign language. And then Ice King's glitchy stuff started eating my dream up. I peed my pants, but you went up and talked to it. You justtalked to it. Then talk to it I will!  Hey, man, tell me the haps. Yeah, tell us your feelings. Get deep. "Sllabfoog uoy pleh t'nac i." CANDY PERSON: Oh, sweet Lord, my face! "Slaw frog yokel snacky." "Snacky slaw frog yokel." "Sea salt yack let a snacky." Yeah, that sounds good. Jake, I think I found a way in! No, wait, dude! I think I cracked the code! There's no time! CANDY PERSON: Aaaah!  This must be the universal source code. Huh? Ice King and Bubblegum? Hmm. FINN: Jake, don't touch anything! Huh? I think these shiny things are the building blocks of the universe, man. They store every single thing that's a thing back on thing. Okay, enough explorin' already. Where's this glitch guy? I'm gonna smash his jimmies! Jake, what is it? Huh?  Unh!  ICE KING: Oh, Princess Bubblegum! Guess who! Can you guess? Can you? I'll give you three chances. No. Okay, four chances.  Ice King, give me the antivirus, or I'll shoot you with my candy horse tranquilizer. But, Sugar, look what I brought you -- a box of chocos. Ugh! Mmm! Still good. Ugh! Look, I can't prove it, but -- you made a promise that I'd have at least one date if --  If I was the last person on Ooooooo  Y-o-o-ou promi-i-i-i-i-sed  Okay. Well, even if I did promise, you're not the last person on Ooo because I'm still here.  Uh Ooh. Hey, I have a hand, too, you know. If I can lend you one Check out my cool hand! Ugh! That's disgusting.  Come on, Jake. Pull it together, man. Jake? Oh. no! My arm! We had so many great times together.  Doo bee doe bee dob bee doe Skibble dee skibble dee Bibbity boppty doo  Huh? Who was that? Aww!  Whoo! Let's do this -- For righty! That's the spirit! Adventure ti-- Oh, my gams. Hold up, dude! My body's Changing! No. Oh, come on, woman! I'm trying to be nice! Can't you at least make the best out of this? Whoa-ho-ho! Are you praying to me? I'm into this. Whoa! I'm still into this. Ohh! Still into it. Aah! Give me the antivirus! ICE KING: I can't, monkey peeps. I didn't make one. The glitch will delete everything until we're all that's left. You mean forever? ICE KING: Well, yeah. I mean, you say that like it's a bad thing. Oh, come on, Finn and Jake. So, hey, Finn, how you plan on taking this guy out?  Okay. I guess it's worth a try.  Aah! What do we do now?! We got to get those things out of his stomach.  Hey. Finn! Remember that gross video Ice King sent? Ugh! Yeah. Yeah! Let's double-team these locks! Hey!  BOTH: We did it!  You should wash your hair. You should wash your mouth. Huh?! No way! Impossible!

Oh, no. Now I feel a thousand times worse. Finn, a story's got to have excitement, romance, suspens-s-s-e, and it has to have a happy ending.  ButI don't know how to make that stuff happen. That's okay, buddy. Just dig me a hole, then. Actually, two holes -- one for my guts and one for my face, 'cause when I die, my guts are gonna blow out of my face! I am not gonna let that happen, dude! Then go get me that story. And make sure it has all the stuff on this list. I'll be back as fast as I can! I won't let your guts blow out of your face! Hmm.

Wild Berry, don't pretend. I know you like the silver foxes. What if it were a little more like real life? Real? It's based on the real Fionna and Cake!

Well, for however long we've got left For once drop it, you freak! Faking it. Faking it. Okay, my shirt is, like, filled with cream puffs. Oh, goodness. Glob, Fionna. You're like the realest person I've ever met. Ow! Oh, my cheek meat! Quit clowning, Fionna. Fionna? Fionna! The end. Oh, I love that one. Oh, come on! You guys got mad at me for a bad story?! I mean, it's cute, but that's not how they'd be. Well, look, it might not be too late to polish this piece of Let's spitball some ideas. Like, if Marshall Lee gets sick and dies. But he's got a brother we didn't know about. His name's Marshall Lee Roy. Boom! Shocker! Ah-ha, I feel goose bumps. - I like how it is. - We like how it is. - Yeah, don't change it. - Yeah. It's good. Everyone get out. Maybe we could start a writing group or whatever. I know you're out there somewhere. I just haven't figured out how to get to you, but, believe me, I will. I will.    This party is so crazy!


    It's slipping, dude.  Phew. "Rainicornicopia -- An Unabridged History of the Rainicorns."  Whatever, man. I barely made it through the title. Listen, man, one day, I'm probably gonna have half-rainbow pupsters. I got to be able to share my babies' culture. Huh.  Oh. Hey, this table is wobbly. We gotta take it to the Lost Tinker Goblin of Fog Mountain to fix it. Dude, I would love to go on some crazy made-up adventure with you, but I really gotta read this. So from here on out, I'm just gonna ignore you.  I don't make up adventures! Jake, you know that! Jake! I don't make up adventures!  Mm. Books books kitties zitties witties mitties knitties fitties hitties jitties pitties cities oh, no! Damaged books! Who did this?! Shh-ush! Sorry. I will avenge the slightly soiled books. Gotta tell Jake.  Hello? Is someone back here? Are you stuck? Shh-ush-oom. Hello? Whoa! Oh! Hey, there's pages coming out of these books! Shhhhhh! Who are you dudes? ALL: We are the Pagelings! I am Paper Pete, the leader of the Pagelings, but you can call me P.P. I'll call you Pete. Okay. Why are you dudes in the library? We are the secret guardians of the books in the library. You know those blank pieces of paper in the beginning of old books? - Yeah. - That's us! We revealed ourselves to you, noble giant, because you felt our plight when you saw the damaged books. And now is our darkest hour, for the Moldos have been growing more bold with every attack. Look at the damage done yesterday at "The Battle of Teddy Bear Joke Book." Wow. Yeah. They're massing for a full-scale assault on every book in the library. Gosh! Even the "Rainicornicopia"? Yes. I better tell Jake. Don't you dudes go anywhere. ALL: Okay. Hey, bro. I've got an adventure. It's not made-up. There are these -- these Pagelings. They came out from -- from books, and they -- they folded into little animals. Do you hear what I'm saying?! Shh! You think I'm making this up? I'll prove it to you!  Finn! Finn! You butt chicken!  Jake, wait 'til you see 'em. Whoa!  - Oh, my goodness! - Oh, golly! Ow!  They were just here! Pagelings? Why didn't you dudes introduce yourselves to Jake? We don't want to reveal ourselves to anyone else. We are the secret guardians -- secret. Um yeah, but Jake is a powerful giant, like me. He can help you battle or -- or whatevs. But first, you must win his favor. Do you not want victory for your people? ALL: Yes! We do want victory! Come on. Follow me. Jake, look. He's up here reading a book. Do something to get his attention. Very well. We shall dance as flowers. ALL: Hoopha! Okay-  Ooh! Ahh! Cha! Cha! Cha! Jake! The Pagelings are dancing for you! Just look up for a second! Finn, all the little voices you're doing are cute, but come on, man, just let me read. By wearing the beast, we shall become like the beast! You can feel them, can't you? I can feel you pinching me. Just look up for a second. Loo-o-o-o-o-o-o-k!  Pagelings, I'm sorry, but my giant friend is acting like a clump. ALL: Okay. We can't wait any longer. We must go back to the bookshelf to prepare for the Moldos' attack. Yeah, go play make-believe somewhere else. I'm not making believe!  We were gone too long!  Wield, my brethren! Wield!  I blows.] Aaaaah! You win this battle, but next time, We will win it. PAGELINGS: Yes! Leave! Yes! We did it! Veni, vidi, vici! So, those little, squishy guys are the Moldos? Aye. This was but a reconnaissance squad sent to test our mettle. ALL: Mettle! Uh-huh. They -- they seem tough. Their bites sting like the dickens. Hmm. Their bites sting, eh? I've got a plan, Pete. Tell me your plan, giant. Just trust me. Trust me.  You've discovered the Moldos' secret lair! Eh, it wasn't very hard.  Wippa Wippa waaaaa! MOLDOS: The Pagelings have a battle beast! Attack!  Whoa, whoa, whoa, moldy blobs. I've come here to help the Moldos defeat the Pagelings. Traitor! Hyah! Yah! Calm down. This is part of my plan. Oh! Ha ha! Then I shall play along, wise giant. How are we to trust you? Well here -- look! I brought y'all a prisoner. It's their leader. May you rot in tartarus! May your skin boil and eyes burst into flames forever in a pit!  Traitor! So, do you guys have, like, a leader or something?  Mildwin! I'm Mildwin, leader of the Moldos. Oh. Uh hmm.  Nice to meet you, your highness. I'm not a king. I was democratically elected.  That's adorable. Now, Finn! Yah! Hunh! Hyah! MOLDOS: Protect the elected official!  PETE: Well-played, oh, giant. You have the cunning of Odysseus. Pete, j-just stop winking. Yo! Yah! Yah! Hyoh! Hyoh! Yah! Shh!  Hup-hup! Ignore this!  Hmm? This tastes delicious!  Aah! Aah! Aah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  What did you do to me?! Aaaaaaaaaaah! - Uh - Aaaaaaaah! Uh uhhh Come on, you guys. Knock it off.  The Moldos got a taste for you now.  Gotta do something! Where can I find ways to solve problems in a library? Books? Aah! Books! Books! Books! Ehhhhh!  Huh?  What you nibbling me for? This sweaty stuff tastes amazing! A-mazing! Hmm. Tastier than battle beast fur. Yes! Hey, Mildwin. - Mildwin! - What? I bring a peace offering from the Pagelings. Hmm? Finn, what's happening? Hang on, buddy. Paper Pete? Giant! Have you wiped out the Moldo horde? No, man. The war's over. Mildwin, you can keep my shirt if you don't attack their library books. Agreed, beast. This filthy garb will feed my people for generations. And in 40 years, you can have my shorts. Sound good, Pete? It will suffice. Sound good, Jake?  Yaaaaaaaaaah!  What -- what the hecks, man?! What'd you do to me?! Look, man! Moldos and Pagelings are real! Wha-- who cares, man?! I'm outta here! Did you finish your Rainicorn book? Ugh. I was reading the same paragraph over and over for like 11 minutes. I guess I'm gonna give up on learning everything about Rainicorn history. Don't tell Lady. Oh. What about, uh, relating to your mixed-species kids? Eh, I'll just fake it. Oh. Well hey, man, I think I see some um sun people in trouble on the sun over there. - You making that up? - Mm-hmm. Yeah! Let's do it! FINN: Whoo! Whoo!    


 Money M-M-Money  Ah. Stand and deliver, boy, because I'm Robbing Hood. Give me all your funny money, Sheriff of Nauty-hams. But, BMO, I don't want to be the bad guy. I want to be Robbing Hood's pal, Frier Tux. No, Neptr. Ha ha! Frier Tux would never have a mustache like that. No fair. En guard! On Blitzen! You're terrible! Whoa! Eee! Aah! What? Hey! What are you kids doing breaking the treehouse?! Uh Yo, BMO, what happened? You got too much money, honey. All of this dosh is threatening the structural integrity of the treehouse. Who would have thought we could have too much treasure? I'm sorry, master. Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant! You told me to stay inside the money room, but now I am outside. What is your punishment, master? No punishment, dude. Just chill where you are. All right. I will chill where I am until you command me. So, what should we do with all this swash? You should give it to Robbing Hood. No way, BMO. This is our treasure. Aw. Hey, maybe we could, like, spend it? Really? How much of it? Dude, like all of it. Then we can go find completely new treasure. Neptr knows just the place to blow your grease. Behold this recent advertisement. Whoa! We get mail? Check it out, Jake. Dang! Wildberry Kingdom got all fancy. I continue to chill. Come on, Nauty-hams. Thank you. Nice place. So, how are we gonna spend all this gish? I don't know. I've never really spent money before. I've only stolen it or hoarded it. Ha! So, here we are in the middle of town. Let's parse out some dough to spend. Hey! What are you doing?! No people or money allowed in the fountain, ya dums! Where's your sense at?! Sorry, man, we were looking to spend some cash in town. Want some? Fellas, goofing in a public fountain is punishable by a lashing, and you're trying to bribe me? Ooh! Now, that's what I'm talking about, fellas. Have a good time in the fountain. Whoa. Spending money is kind of fun. Yeah, this'll be easy. Ho, ho, young berry lads! Yeah? Go buy the most expensive meats and furniture to adorn our new fountain home. Keep the change for your families in need. Hyup! Thanks, but we're, uh, middle-class. - Really? - Uh, yeah, upper middle. Just get the darn furniture. Hey, no furniture or meat in the fountain! You'll wreck up the water! You can't buy me off twice, fellas. Ah, maybe you can, fellas, maybe you can. Dude, we bought all this furniture and meat, and we still have a ton of gamboni left. Hmm. Look at those gams! Hey, yo, legs! Legs! You want a bag of money? Sure! Well, what are you gonna do for it? Well, um, I'm a dancer by trade. Show me. Hup! Finn, look. I made this guy dance. Yeah, man. Whoo! Hold it! No dancing in the streets without a permit! Go away, dude. Hey, you can't talk to me like that. All right, I'm going! This is crazy. People do anything for money. And I've got a ton of money. Dance harder, Legs! Harder! This bores me. You're boring! It's time to push this thing further. Middle-class berries, watch after this treasure while I'm gone. - Okay. Mayble, do you hear something? Good evening. Oh, no! We're being robbed! Oh, no, we're not robbers. We're actually here to give you money. - What? - Listen. I want to see you two do things for this bag of money. Okay, man. Yeah, nice. Goji Berry Man, you sleep on the left side of the bed normally. Now you sleep on the right! Okay. I don't like sleeping on your side. It's too close to the wall! Mr. Goji Berry, you sleep on your back now and on top of the covers. I can't sleep on my back, man. I got sleep apnea. I won't get any sleep. My wife won't get any sleep. My dance instructing will suffer. Turning down all this smoosh, huh? Dance instructing pays more that I thought. Wait, man! There's got to be something else we can do to get those gold coins. Well, sure, man. As a matter of fact, you can have all the gold coins all the gold coins you can eat! Dinner is served! Yummy, yummy, yummy. Hey, you kids need some dessert? I'll just see what I can rustle up in the toolshed! Guys, I'm super sorry about my friend. Here. Don't eat it, ya dums! How much do you think I'd have to pay them to lick the dust off of all this dusty stuff? Dude, I do not approve of the way you're spending money right now. Dude, they're not doing anything they don't want to. They want my sweet cheddar, and I want to see some stuff in exchange. It's mutual free market. - What? - Free market! Don't worry, brother. I'll help you see the error of your ways. Berry lads! Berry lads! I need to spend all this blingo fast. Okay. Take me to the seediest alley in the kingdom. That's Crudberry Back Alley in Crud Town. Friendly Crudberries, I have money for you! Come get it! - Money? - Money? Money! - Money? Money! - Money! Easy, fellas! Let's pass these out one at a time. Hey, take it easy, breh. Give us that money! I-I-I don't want any trouble. I'm trying to help you. Whew! How much coin would it take for you to be my berry foot warmer? - Dude! - Oh, hey, man. Jake, this money is bad. We got to get rid of all of it right now. Okay, I got a plan. And this time, it's gonna involve all the money.  M-M-Money M-M-Money, Money Money Money Money M-M-Money  Finn and Jake? Princess, are you ready to earn all this cay-ash? Wha? All of this sweet, sweet crunkle is yours if you let me sit on your head. Get out of here! Psh, no one can say no to this much dinero.  M-M-Money  Jake, I am warning you.  M-M-Money M-M-Money  Aah! Guards! Guards! Seize Finn and Jake and prepare them for execution! Or don't do that and get paid mad bucks. And take all their money! Take all my money?! Well, we were trying to get rid of all that skrilla anyway, right? Finn and Jake, yes, you have insulted me, but worse than that, you have abused the power of money! We will deal with you swiftly and ironically by encasing you in your own molten gold! Release the golden flood! Oh, no! Aah! Who dares? Ho, ho, ho! Robbing Hood is the defender of the poor! - Me too! - Good shot, BMO! I was aiming for the rope. Yeah! Let's bounce, po' boy. Finn and Jake, if you ever return to Wildberry Kingdom again, I'll have you double-dipped in gold! Unless I get a written apology. Huh? Gold piece. You want to flip to see who writes that apology letter? How about you write it, I sign it? No way, man.    This party is so crazy!


  - BMO, when is something going to happen? - Shh! Just watch. It happens once a month. I promise. This is it! Oooh! - But where does it go? - That's none of our business. Tickets! Get your tickets here! See the world's greatest tiny circus! Witness the amazing wood-eating termite! - The mighty strong-ant! - You're late, Blue Nose! Get into makeup! Too much artsy, not enough fartsy. We talked about this, clown! Wasn't that mething? Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, you're perfectly safe. But at this time, I'd like to ask anyone with a medical condition to please leave the premises at once. What you're about to witness with your own eyes may shock and astound you to your very core. Tonight, I give you the wildest, most dangerous beast anywhere in Captivity! The horrible, the stupendous Goralina! Attagirl! Don't worry, Junior. It's all part of the act. Blue Nose! Boy, am I glad to see you. Come in, come in! Sit down. You did good out there tonight with the belly-dancing routine. Real good. Aw, don't give me that look. I know we said we were going to let the chipmunk go at the end of last season, but Goralina is our big draw! You understand that. We're barely breaking even here. What do you want from me?! Look, there's another show in an hour. You come up with an act that can rival Goralina, then we can talk. But look what she got us last night Three whole pennies. Think you can make me this kind of cash? You do that, I won't need the chipmunk anymore. I'll let her go, just like I promised. But you're gonna have to lose the fancy-schmancy stuff and give the people what they want! Get it?! The old Blue Nose magic. Aren't you glad we came back for the second show? Oho! You were great, kid! That's what I'm talking about. With you and the chipmunk in the show, we're gonna have a real 1, 2 punch! Hey I know what I said, but I want to see how many boxcars this gravy train has on it. Look at her. It's like looking at a big sad dollar sign. Yipe! Whoa-ho! Oh! That's right. Lift with your legs first, then put your back into it. There he is. Gotcha! Thought you could skip out, eh? And start your own circus! Yeah, you! You and your corny clown hat! - Hey, he's smiling! - What's so funny? - You rat! You creep! - What's the big joke? Haha! Neat!


      Yeah, you think you're pretty way up there, but l can get you.  All right. Let me just add three more drops of explosive diarrhea  BOTH: Ooh! Hey, Princess Bubblegum, when we bring the dead back to life, will they be filled with worms? No. lf my decorpsinator serum works, then all the dead candy people will look as young and healthy as you do. Ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh! Pick up that platter, tough guy. FlNN: Old Mr. Creampuff?  We used to date.  Something's happening! Come on! Come on! Work! Sug-g-gar! Algebraic! Wait. Something's wrong. Sugar!  BOTH: Ohh! Aah! Whoo-hoo!  Hey, look! The decorpsinator serum is working. No! This is wrong! They're not coming back to life! They're still dead! My decorpsinator serum -- it's incomplete! Rah! Must eat sugar!  You're grounded, Mister. Oh, this is really bad. They're going to be attracted to the Candy Kingdom. Why? Because the candy people are made of sugar, you ding-dong! Gimme some sugar, baby. Aah! Chew on this!  Good one, Finn. Quickly! To the kingdom! Get a life!  All citizens of the Candy Kingdom! Report to the palace immediately! Let's go. The Princess needs us. Whoa!  Hurry, sweet citizens. All right! You heard the Princess! Everyone in! All right. No pushing. Come on. Dude, what's up? The Princess will explain everything. Tree trunks, get those hot buns in here, girl. Oh, l hope it's not bad news.  Did we get everyone? MAN: All present and accounted for. FlNN: Thanks, Manfried. You're welcome. Citizens, we are assembled here in the candy foyer for a momentous announcement. Tonight, we are all going to havea slumber party! What?!  Wait, what about the zom-- go ahead and start partying!  But, Princess, the undead! We'll be right back, everyone. Whoo! Finn, the candy people can't know about the zombies. Wha?! lf they knew, they would flip out! What do you mean, ''flip out''? l mean they would flip out! Princess? lt's me -- Starchie the Gravedigger. l brought you a larger corpse shovel. Uh, Princess? Well, l'll just wait for you here, then, by the Mausoleum, with my back turned and my defenses lowered. - Huh? Sugar! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Candy people explode when they get scared?! Not telling the candy people about the zombies is so important that you need to promise -- royal promise -- not to let anyone find out about the zombies -- ever. Okay. Sure. No, Finn. You have to Royal promise. Yes, l royal promise. Now, l must cloister myself in the lab and finish the equation to my decorpsinator serum. You keep the candyfolk distracted and ignorant. Can you do that? Yes, your highness. Good. Don't tell anyone about the zombies -- never, ever. Oh, wait. Can l at least tell Jake? Tell me about what, dude? You know, about the outbreak of zom--  All right, what's going on? Uhhhuh, nothing at all, buddy!  Hey, dude, l think you and Bubblegum are up to something. Aah!  What? No! No way! Whoa! You guys are up to something! ls it some sort of prank? Can l get in on it? Who wants to play ''Truth or Dare''? Hmm. Okay. Chocoberry, you may choose someone to ask a deep truth or a saucy dare.  Mr. Cupcake, truth or dare? Dare. l dare you to take off your wrapper. ALL: Ooooooh!  Hey, seriously, man, l'm your bro. Bros are supposed to tell bros everything all the time. What are you and Bubblegum up to? ls everything all right? Yep -- fine. Everything is great. Except for that. Whoa! l didn't know he was chocolate. Jake, tr-r-r-r-uth or dare? Truth. Do you prefer chocolate or fudge? l can't eat chocolate or fudge 'cause l'm a dog and they would probably kill me, buthmmprobably Neither! Finn, truth or dare? Dare! Ha ha! l dare you to tell me the truth about what's going on in your mind. What were you and Bubblegum talking about when you were alone together? ALL: Oooooooh! Ummuh the truth isuhh You promised you wouldn't frickin' tell anyone! Oh, you're so cute, Finn. Uhhh the truth is that l'd rather play ''dodge socks''!  l'm not playing ''Dodge Socks'' till you stop dodging my questions. Hey.  Old Mr. Creampuff? lsn't he dead? Uh, give me my sock back! ''Dodge Socks'' was a bad idea! Whoa! Look, dude, just tell me what's up, because you are crazier than a cannibal tonight.  Oh, my goodness. Princess hasn't finished the equation, and the zombies are here! l, uh just want this slumber party to be super-fun! And if l did have something to tell you, then l would, in a second, and it would make my life easier, unless there was something stopping me, like a promise, but there isn't, so l won't, so it's cool. Sugar! What? You lost me. Uhhey you know what time it is? Adventure Time? No! Time for ''Seven Minutes in Heaven .'' - You're first! - Really?! Lady Rainicorn, in the closet with Jake!  Okay, okay, all right. JAKE: But in seven minutes, l'm gonna come out there and make you spill your beans, Finn. l can't hear you all the way in heaven! Sugar! Must eat sugar! Sugar!  Um does anyone else hear that? What?  Hear what? l-l don't hear anything.  l hear something l don't understand, and it makes me scared! What?! No, Chet. Everybody wait. What noise? You mean thls noise?  Oh!  Yeah! Dance it! Bust it up! Uh-oh-oh! What is this game you are playing at now, Finn? Uhhh lt's ''Blockado.''  The game of barricades. Come on -- let's block all the entrances and windows.  Blockado! Blockado! All right, this is not a permanent solution.  Think, Finn. How can you keep everyone from finding out? MANFRlED: Find out about what, Finn? Manfried! The talking piÃ±ata! Your convenient appearance gives me a great idea! Everybody, grab a stick! New game -- we're gonna smash some piÃ±atas! What?! Except for you, Manfried. Oh, thank goodness. Now, everybody don these blindfolds. Thanks, taffy girl.  All right, everybody, get together. l'm hanging the piÃ±atas. They're all around you. Smash the piÃ±atas!  Yeah! Hwah! Hwah! Hyah! Wah!  Yeah! You guys are on fire! Ehh! Mmm! Mmm! Oh, it is so tasty. We did it! My improbable plan worked. Whew! Annyong! Seven minutes up yet?  Whoa!  What the nuts happened here?! Oh, we killed all the zombies that Princess Bubblegum and l raised from the dead. Really?! Huh? J-Jake? What's going on? Wha?  Finn! Did you break your royal promise?! Yeah, but l mean, all the zombies are dead. The candy people won't freak out. What's the big deal? This is really, really bad, Finn! You can't break royal promises -- never, ever, never, no matter what, forever!  The guardians of the royal promise are coming for us.   Finn the Human, you have broken a royal promise, for which the penalty is trial by fire.  That's stupid. Wait! He's my friend! lsn't there another option?! Yes. Because you care for the promise-breaker, we will give him a less-hot trial. You must now answer  Math questions! Mathematical! Finn, you're terrible at math. Aww! Nowsolve thls!  Oh. Wait, wait. l thought of a better one. Yes! ''2+2''! Solve it or die. Uhh  Oh. Correct. FlNN: What's happening, Princess? You defeated the broken royal promise! The gumball guardians are resetting! BOTH: Whoa! Oof! Slam-a-cow! That was tops! Who's not good at math? l was all, ''4!''  That's it! The answer was so simple, l was too smart to see it! You're welcome. ''4'' is the last figure l need to perfect my decorpsinator serum.  Golly!  Whoo-hoo! Yeah! This is messed up. But sweet.  Uncle chewy! Grandma! Former dead relative! Starchie! Mornin'. Man, you broke a royal promise? You're nuts. All's you had to say was that it was a royal secret. l know what's up. l hope you grasp the full consequences of breaking promises. Heck yeah! lf l break a royal promise, l get to fight zombies, throw slumber parties, awake gumball guardians, and -- and -- All right, all right! And reverse death itself! Oh, you are adorable. But keep your promises, okay? l will, Princess.  Starchie, you're not a zombie. l can't help it. Flesh is delicious. You're delicious! Oh!  Don't squeeze me. l'll fart. 


    Are you okay, dude? Yeah. Why? You look bored. Nah. That's just how l look when l'm listening to music. Well, good, because l'm about to kick it up a notch. Bring it. Who do you think it is? Could be anybody. l can't quite make it out.  Aah! lt's the lce King! The lce King?! l think this is the right address. Maybe this is -- is this West? Hyah! Yeah, kick his butt, dude! Wah! Wah! Wah! Eat my sword, lce King! Yeah! Aw! You cannot defeat me, child! l will, though, with a sweet kick! Psych!  Aah! Unh! Oh, wait. Wait, wait. Oh, l am so stupid! Silly Billy! l came by to tell you the good news. What's the good news? l'm getting married to someone who wants to marry me. My betrothed is right over there. Hi, honey. Hey, cool guy. l'm a lucky guy. l didn't even have to kidnap this one. She fell in love with me the moment l slipped on her engagement ring. Ew! Bye-bye!  The lady penguins are throwing her one of those ''Bachelorette'' parties. This is weird, dude. Hmm. lf you get married, what about capturing Princesses? Oh, well. No more capturing pretty Princesses for this lce King.  Oh. Well, fare thee well, lce King. Huh? Yeah, good luck with thee and thy creepy wedding. We totally support your decision to stop capturing Princesses. l'm happy for him. Sure wish someone would throw me a bachelorette party -- Oh, l mean, ''Manlerette'' party. But we hate you. lf you won't throw me a Manlerette party, then l'll never have my last hurrah before buckling down with that battle axe! lt'll drive me back to a life of stealing hot Princesses! ls that what you want?! No. No, no, no, no, no. Dude, we got to show him a good time and treat him right. Otherwise, he'll go back to imprisoning ladies. l-l can't have that! l -- Shh! l know. l know that you can't have that. Don't worry. All right, let's go party, lce King. Best Manlerette party ever!   Bah! Aah!  Now l'm gonna go get marrled! l'm gonna get married! Bye, lce King! Good luck! Have fun being married! No more stealing Princesses! Yeah -- wait. No more st-stealing Princesses? Wow. BOTH: What?! l-l didn't realize l'd have to give up stealing the ladies. But you said you were fine with it. l know what l said, but, you know, sometimes you say things and then you don't really mean them. Wha-- are you serious? l'm just not sure l want to get married in such a hurry. What if she's just after my demonic wishing eye and ghost pouch?  We just took you out partying so that you could feel better about getting hitched! Maybe l'll just go back to capturing lots of girls. lt's what l feel comfortable doing, you know? Being free, wind at my back, lots of girls, kidnapping 'em. All right, here comes my double kick! Finn, Finn, cool yourself, buddy. We need to get this guy married, remember? Yeah, l remember. Watch. Let big brother handle this. Hey, lce King, don't be nervous. Marriage is the most beautiful thing that could ever happen to a jerk like you. Oh, really? Why? Why? Poots, that guy is good. Why? Why?! Jake. Not now! Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? My mind is made up 80% sure -- No marriage. Well, uh, don't you, uh, want to grow old with somebody, right? Just like these old swans.  Bleh, those stinky, old swans. Huh?  ALL: What?! Oh, now l get what you guys are trying to tell me. Marriage is a thing that allows me to capture a Princess forever and let her live inside of me.  Marriage is the most beautiful thing in the world! Uh yeah, l-l never, uh l guess it is. Jake, this is bad news, man. We got to go tell him that he can't eat his wife. Eh, let's cross that bridge when we get to it. Look at how happy he is. The wedding -- back on 1 00% !  Whew! All that's left is the lousy wedding. l'm weddy for the wedding! You know, even though the lce King is a wad, l'm pretty happy for him. JAKE: Uh-huh. This wedding looks lame, man. Be prepared to be bored out of your mind.  lCE KlNG: Finn, Jake, you made it. Come on up here. l'm almost finished tying up my bride. Weird. And your bride is lnto that? This is a traditional wedding ritual for good luck in the lce Kingdom. You see, she'll be hoisted up and then lowered down. And when she touches my beard from above, she will be my Queen.  Well, cool, man. l'm glad y'all are happy being crazy together. Thank you. Excuse me as we finish preparing for the nuptials. Yes, 32, 64, 1 00 And Huh?! Her eyes are huge. l'm gonna go check 'em out. Stop scratching your ear, man. lt's gross. lt wasn't me. lt was my foot, dude. Whoa, you've got ridiculously large eyes, Princess. Are you allergic to something? No, Finn. l was just born like this. Why are you crying? l'm not crying, Finn. My tear sack is broken. Help me! What?! l didn't say anything. The lce King cursed me! You've got to set me free! l would rather die than marry the lce King!  He tricked me! And l was happy for that son of a toot! Look at her ring. She fell in love with me the moment l slipped on her engagement ring. FlNN: That's what cursed her! Don't worry, Princess. l'll remove this ring and save your life. No, she's my love boat! No, man, you cursed her! She hates you! Okay, that's your opinion! Wait a minute.  So, you knew she was cursed all along, which means you knew she wasn't trying to steal your demonic eye junk or whatever, and you knew you had total control of her. Yeah, yes, that's right. So then why did you make us go through all that junk about why marriage is worth stuff?! Oh, l don't know. l'm complicated -- and spontaneous.  That's probably why she wants to marry me. She wants to marry you because you brainwashed her! Silence! BOTH: Whoa, wait! Aw, man! lt's time for the lowering ceremony!  Hoist her up!  Commence the lowering!  Hyah! Yes, nothing can stop me now. Hyah! Oh! Whoa! Unh! Aah!  Strangling the groom's nose at a wedding?! Aaaah! What's wrong with you?! You're the one that there's something wrong with! Aaaaaaah! Huh?!  Gotcha! Thanks, man.  No problem.  l think you dropped something. Catch! - Huh?  Whoa! Jake! What? What? Jake!  Oh, hey. - Hey. You got the ring off her finger? JAKE: Huh? Oh, oh, yeah. Now she's not hypnotized. But we're still frozen. l got a plan. Oh, good. Now let's try that again. Lower her! You lousy, butt-faced pig! l hate you! Here she comes. Yes, touch my beard, deary. Yes, that's right. Almost there. Now!  Oh! l'm married, right, Snowman? Yes, it's official. lt's official! You done married a dog, dude! What? What's that supposed to -- Oh, no.  Wait, what the -- What am l laughing about?  And now everything's back to normal. Well, l wouldn't say everything. Come on, guys. Help me celebrate my un-marriage. 


     PRlNCESS BUBBLEGUM : All right, guys, hammer all these safety signs around this dungeon hole. l've got to jet off on my swan to take care of some royal junk. You got it, Princess. Whatever you want, mama. Bubblegum, away!  Ow. Ow. Ow. There. That's the last sign, Jake. Now no one will ever go down this hole ever. Probably a lot of dangerous, awesome stuff down this hole. l better go take a look.  Don't, dude. For you see that's the secret entrance to the dungeon of the crystal eye. Whoa. Legend has it that the eye rests in the deepest chamber of this accursed dungeon. Man, we shouldn't even be talking about it 'cause it's lunchtime. The crystal eye. l want to meet this dungeon. Maybe after lunch. Eh, l'll skip lunch. Just catch up to me when you finish.  Yeah, right. - What? Without the aid of my magnificent powers  Huh? Huh? You'd get killed down there. Hey, l can do things without you! You want to bet l can't? Nope. Come get your sandwich. Listen to Jake, Finn. He only wants what's best for --  Aah! Help me! Aah! Come put her out of her misery, dude! We are betting! l bet that l'll get that crystal eye and be back within 1 1 minutes! Ready set go!  l better go after him. No, Jake. Stay hereWith me.  Oh, my. Dungeons! Chambers! Whoa! Evil creatures!  Treasure chests! Whoo!  Doorways! Traps! Yah! l'm in my eleme-e-e-e-e-e-nt!  Huh? Meow? Oh! Mroooooow Oh?  Whoa! Somebody come pick up your freaky cat! Greetings Frank the human boy. How did you almost know my name?! l have approximate knowledge of many things. For instance, l know that l am possibly going to slay you and munch on your eyeballs. Heh. Yeah, right. That sounds like idiot talk. You're trespassing on my dungeon, manling. And l am the thing you should be afraid of. You can't hurt me! l'm a radical boy on a mission for the crystal eye! l'm going to unzip your skin and wear you like a little coat. Unzip this!  Ha!  Bleep! Oof!  Yeow! Now you die!  - Aah! - Wait a second.  ls that dog smell?! You -- you have a dog with you? l'm out of here! Yeah, right! Good excuse! Slaps. That cat was kicking my buns. And it might have finished my buns if it weren't for Jake's stank. Dang it, Jake! l'll get that crystal eye on my own! With my own odors. Pressing on! Let's see. No to skeletal-remains door.  Whoa! No to giant monster mouth door. Oh! Giant key door it is! lf Jake was here, he could stretch his hand into a key and open it.  Yeah! Key hand!  Ouch. Hey. What the jug is that? Oh, sweet! The key!  Oh, key we're meant to be l want to have your baby Oh, key, you're so good to me  Ugh! Jelly cube?!  Come on! Give it to me! Don't flaunt it if you're not gonna give it up! Unh!  l'll never get that crystal eye! No. No, l just got to stay pumped. Pump it up! Pump it up! Whoo! Whoo! Shake it, shake it! Whoa! Oof! Steady, Finn. This place is probably more creeped out of you than you are of it. Hup! MAN: Halt! Come no further, adventurer! For you see, none can defeat the bucket knight! Okay. Then l won't fight you. No! You must challenge me to -- Hey, cutie, do you know how to get the crystal eye from here? Yes, it's through that door over there, but -- - Thanks! - Hey!  You can't pass through that door without battling me! Yes, l can! Because l'm huge compared to you! Just add water and exponential growth! Aw, buckets. Now activate thine own powers, and we shall engage in thrilling single combat! Heh, thing is l don't really have any powers. l see. Aaaaaaaah! Dang it! Jake wouldn't be running! He'd grow all big. And sock you right in the nose hole!  Whoa! Aah! Aw, nutzoids! Haaah!  Come on! All aboard the knuckle train to fist planet! Oof! Unh!  l rode the knuckle train? But l'm in my element. Yaaaaaah! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Unh! That sucked.  All right, Finn. You're in a heavy pickle here. You don't have Jake, but you can still handle this! Meow? You can still get that crystal eye!  Hey my dinner is back. And your dog isn't with you. That's what you said, right? Jack the dog is not ''accompanying'' you? You mean Jake? Jake, jack, whatever. He's not here, which means l'm going to rip your heart out. Crud, crud, crud, crud, crud! You can't hide from me, Jim! l know almost everything, remember?! l know exactly where you might be, Jim. l'm about to pounce on you. One two three! Aw, man! Thought you'd be behind this rock. Hmm.  All right, l know where you are now, and l'm about to pounce again!  Aw, man! Well, there's only a few more places to look. Oh, Jake l'm such a fool! A silly, silly fool! Shh. Who the heck -- Hey lt's okay. Shh. l'm your guardian angel, Finn. l'm here to save you. R-Really? Mm-hmm. Come here. Let the angel pick you up. Oh. Okay.  This is radical! Are you comfortable? Would you like some snacks? l'm fine, thank you. Here. Let me clean you up and mend your clothes.  l'm taking you to the chamber of the crystal eye Aw, yeah! where l'm going to cook you and eat your flesh. Wow Wait. What?! Trust in your guardian angel! Put me down, lady! As you wish. Waaah! Unh! Aw, man. Everyone wants to eat me up. lt's probably 'cause l'm so sweet. Now, for little-kid soup. The secret is a low flame over a long period. That's Jake's secret, too. Sure hope he saves me. l will save thee, Finn. Lady, you are sick! - Oh, Jake. - What? - Jake! - Finn! What are you doing here? Heh, heh, l was looking for you, knucklehead. l was so worried that, right after lunch, l plunged into the dungeon after you. Strangest thing, though. l kept running into obstacles. Choose your dueling weapon! Eh Um uh, l choose Sandwich!  The challenges were impossible for me. But you would have blown right through them. l kept asking myself, ''what would Finn do?'' Justfrustrating. You know what l mean. Yeah, l think l do.  Now let's figure out a way out of this cage! Got it covered with key hand! l don't see any keyholes in this cage, though. Not a problem, man. Lock hand! l'll get us out with carrot hand! Heh heh. Aah! Come on, man. We still got a couple minutes left to steal that crystal eye and win your bet! Wait. You'd help me win a bet that l made about how l could accomplish something without you? Just hop on my powdered doughnut, boy! Cling!  There it is -- the crystal eye! Let's give this the good old friendship lift!  Whoa. Friendship, g-o-o-o! Hyah! At least if l die, l'll die with my best friend! Me too! Get on my swan! - Ooh! - Okay!  l hope you learned a lesson from all this! Uh, we learned that two heads are better than one head? Working together is better than not working together? Whatever. Grr. lt looks like that's not the answer she wanted. Uh l learned that you are a very, uh, intelligent Princess? You're darn right l am. Yeah! All right! Princess Bubblegum, awa-a-a-a-a-a-y!  


Adventure time, come on, grab your friends, we'll go to very distant lands. With Cake the cat and Fionna the human the fun will never end. It's adventure time!  Ugh. Huh? Wha? Where am I? Gunther? Gunther? I don't think this is Gunther. - It's me, Ice King. - Lumpy Space Princess? - Yeah. - And you're doing this because you like me? No. Ice King, listen. I'm gonna give you the straight dope. - Okay. - You're weird and old, and you kidnap princesses. - I know. - But I asked you here tonight, because I want to know what you think of this. "The prince who wanted everything, a Fionna and Cake adventure?" - Hey, why isn't my name on there? - I want you to read it because you're their dad. Please be their dad right now and bring them to life! Okay. Might as well, at least until the cops show up. "Once upon a time, there was a most handsome prince, the future - king of Lumpy Space, Lumpy Space Prince." - Where do you want these - gold-plated sandwiches, your highness? - By the window! No! That's not how I sound! Read it in a better voice! Okay, okay. Sheesh! By the window, for from the window shall I shower the poor with presents, as is my altruistic nature. Eat! Eat, my children! - Son! Come here at once! - But all was not perfect for this philanthropic prince of the people. His parents were slobbering monsters who didn't care that he was a beautiful prince. They wanted him to be a monster, too. Why aren't you working on your monster exercises? - I don't want to be a monster. - Eat these worms! - No! - You will eat them! - I won't eat them. - Sharpen your teeth! - No! - Eat these worms! Eat those worms and sharpen those teeth! No, no, no! I've told you hundreds of times that I don't want to be a monster! And there is nothing you can do about it! Ugh! Where am I? Who's there? Reveal yourself! Hmm. Citizens of this realm, I am the one and only heir to the throne of the Lumpy Space Kingdom. I mean, I used to be. I rebelled against my parents, and now I'm a refugee. What's that? You wish to help me? I'm touched! Fetch me some clothes and I'll pay you handsomely by petting you. First, I need freaky clothes! Cool freaky, not monster freaky. Oh, yes, and something to read, as well, something mind-blowing. Oh, wait! I also need servants. Recruit some locals. They won't mind. Hmm. Not bad. Well done, my child. Next! "Massenpsychologie und ich-analyse." - That does sound mind-blowing. - Hiya. Hiya! Cake, I'll save the captives. You take care of those animals. Yaaah! Ha! Dance, you puppets! Ha! Ha! Hiya! - You're free to go, people! - Whoo! - Hey, those were my servants. - Hmm? What an innocent face. It shines as if you have done no wrong. - Do you like my freaky clothes? - I don't care about your clothes. Hey, you're not supposed to read it like that. - Say it in a nicer way! - I, uh "I don't" - care about your clothes. - You don't? Finally, someone who's not impressed with my noble looks, but admires what's inside of me. - Hmm? - Is this really happening? Your clothes are so raggedy and soiled, and yet you use them as a napkin. You care not about your personal appearance, nor hygiene. Dress me in the fashion of this peasant. I have much to learn from you, Fionna the human. - How'd he know your name? - Unh! - Judo chop! Hiya! Hiya! - Hmm, your movements are so free. My parents only want me to fly like a proper monster, stiff and rigid, with a sharp-toothed scowl permanently in place. But now I see a new way to move. Dance with me. - Y'all seeing those big, floaty faces? - Pretty. No! Release! - Ugh! What just happened? - You were under my handsome spell for a moment. We can never marry, you know. I can only be with someone who's my equal in every way, a person so much like me that she doesn't even exist. I don't care, as long as we can hang out. Anyone want a sandwich? Oh, I'll have one. So rustic, so humble. Delightful! Wait. Where are your baby tables? What?! You don't dip your foods in gold before eating?! Who eats gold? Great glob! What is this?! So charming, so quaint, so self-reliant! Omh! For years, I've thought only of the needs of my people, but what about me? What do I need? This poorly made sandwich has enlightened me!  How pleasant to be living in the present A peasant eating crud instead of pheasant Just like this cat and dirty adolescent to feed! That's all I need I'm fab and fit and fine and firm and able No longer need a baby for a table Can't pin me down with any kind of label I'm freed! I'm freed! That's all I need! That's all I need I also need this cup. Don't bother getting up. Farewell to fancy friends and party platters! I'm happy now, and that is all that matters! So take my lead! And heed my creed That's all you need! That's all you need!  What I want is to be like you, Fionna the peasant! - And I'll need you as my pet, Cake the cat. - Yeah, whatever. - Huh? - Son! Flee, noble Fionna, for it is my stupid parents. - And they're fatter than ever! - Silence! Aah! I'm just being honest. Huh? Come on, you beautiful dandy. Only your pierced spirit can defeat your evil family. And this sword. - Whoo! - You're right, Fionna. This is my destiny. I do have the power. - Huh? Fionna! - You must obey! - Ugh! My heart! - Submit, young one. Become a true monster. - No. It isn't right. - Silence! Ugh! Aah! Oh, Fionna, this is the end for me. But at least I made you proud. - Didn't I? - I don't care. My glob, Fionna. You've been telling me the answer all along. The only way to defeat parental disapproval is not caring about anything.  I don't care!  - Aah! Aah! - I don't care! lsp! - Cake's helping! - I don't care! Thank you, son. You've freed us from adult mediocrity and fatuousness. I don't care! Fionna, Cake, both of you, buy me dinner. Yes, your hotness. "and then Lumpy Space Prince became so real that he could actually break through into this plane of existence" Whoa! "and meet his one true love, Lumpy Space Princess. It was really happening. The secret portal began to shake and tremble. The countdown began.


     You got that cooler, buddy? Yep. Good, 'cause we're gonna need it for this roof party!  Watch this, everybody. Triple flip with chips for the dip. Watch this, everybody. A cooler with stuff for the thing. Finn, you always focus an endless amount of energy on everything you do. What about me? What do I focus my energy on, Cinnamon Bun?

Whoa, dude, can you, like, get off of me? Do you think your energy could be used to power a huge machine? I-I guess so, man.  Hey, Jake, your friend is superweird, dude.  I thought he was your friend. PRINCESS BUBBLEBUM: It's starting, everyone -- the celestial alignment. ALL: Ooh! Whoa! Whoa! Oh!  Ooh! Mm!  Jake, that party was superfun! Man, I'm sleepy.  Then go to sleep, man. Huh? Oh, yeah, right.  Good night, homey. Hyah!  Good night, Hamlet.  Crang!  What? All right, all right, you old gut. Whoa, I'm sluggin' it today. Wake up, Finn. Got a busy day ahead of us. Finn? Hmm. Hmmmm. Where's Finn? Where is Finn?  Is he in the kitchen? Does he have a pumpkin? Rima, tima, tin-tin Dooba, dooba, dumplin' Poopy, doopy, pie tin Monkey watermelon Welcome, Finn. Huh? Untie me so I can beat you with that sack! You're that -- Yes, the charismatic stranger from last night, also the grand master of the gnomes! Hup! Hup! Hup! And ruler of the beneathaverse! It's pretty nice. Hey, why don't you guys just untie me, and we can pretend this whole thing didn't happen. Oh, no. I've been searching all over Ooo for the ultimate power source -- a living dynamo, something that never slows down. Uh-oh. And last night, I finally found -- It's me. Yes, it's you! You will have the great honor of powering the upturn-over-drive! That does what now? It will flip over the entire world. Then we'll be the ones on top, buddy. That's bizonkers! Yes, but the engineering is very sound. Huh? Your energies will be harnessed by our most advanced technology -- the cyclonic rodentarod! Ha! You may have captured me huh! but you can't make me run. Ow! Well, you can't make me run very fast.  Ow! Jake's on his way to mess you guys -- Aaaah!  Finn!  Finn! Finn?!  Man, where is that kid? I'm really starting to worry. Take my sandwich, Beemo. I'm gonna go find fi--  a dancing bug.  Hey, man, you're shakin' it all wrong. But shakin' it's all I know. Shh. Let me show you how it's done.  Oh, yeah! Ha ha! Yeah! Whoo! Congratulations. You fully charged the alternator. Now it's time to power up the plasma ball with sexy, fun dancing. No! Stop! No! Whoa! Aah!   ALL:  Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Aah!  Whoo!  Whoo! Any more grass shakes, Simon? All finished. Finished, huh? Ahh! Finished. Finished. Finn. Finn. Finn. Oh, Finn! Darn it! My best friend's missing! I got to get my head together, get undistracted, and use all of my skills to track him down. Smelling  touching tasting looking.  Little footprints. Too small to be Finn's. More like "a bunch of gnomes carrying something" footprints.  Hey, I've got a joke. What did the mermaid sea -- a movie? W-What? Oh, I messed it up. But it's still funny, right? Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, it's not! Y'all are horrible at telling jokes. Let me hit you with this. Did you hear about the goblin who got his left arm and left leg cut off? BOTH: Um No. That's okay. He's all r ig h t now. What?  Now for the final stage -- the brain machine. No! GNOME: Yes! This machine will suck the energy from your thoughts to start our upturn-over-drive.  FINN: Don't think, Finn. Don't think anything. Can'tletthemwin! Hyah! Whaa! Hyah! Raaa!  No more games. Nomore pajamas! BOTH: No!  Whoa! Jake?! Jake! Whoa, man! I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again.  I-I can't -- It's working! ALL:  Jake! Jake! Jake! Whoo! Yeah! Ha ha ha!  Man, this party is nuts! How'd I even get up here? You blacked out after laughing so hard at your own jokes. You were off the hook. So we brought you to the cloud kingdom to party with The Party God. Whoa! Who's The Party God? I am The Party God! Oh. Jake, you have won my favor for being a completely off-the-hook party dog. And because your gut waves please me so, I will grant you one wish. What do you want most in the world? What do I want most?  What do I want most in the world? Well, I wish Finn would stop leaving his dirty --  Finn! I was on his trail, and then I got distracted. Aah! What's wrong with my brain? Cinnamon Bun was right. I can't focus on nothing! Party God, I wish that I could focus on finding my friend Finn.  Then your wish is my -- Wait, wait. Is there some kind of catch? Uhy-y-yes. Y-You got me. To grant your wish, I will have to fill you with the energy of a thousand partying demons. You will become so overloaded with party energy that you'll demolish everything in your path! Must find Finn! Must -- must party forever! It's working! It's working!  Party!!  Partay! Step back, everybody. I'm gonna shake it. Unh! Unh! You feeling this? Fire the shooty-gun-ray! High five! ALL: Freeze! Let's kick it! Whoa! Ha ha! I bet I can lift this thing. Jake? Jake! You defeated the gnomes. - I did? - Yeah, man! - And you're okay? - Yeah, man, I'm fine! Ha ha! Then I did it. I saved you by being an unfocused, rowdy party dog. Ha ha. Yeah, dog. Ha ha ha! Yeah! Let's go eat Cinnamon Bun.    !


     BUBBLEGUM:  Whew! Ladies and gentlemen, I have invented time travel. This phasical sphere is flooded with info waves that scan every second, logging every molecule that passes through its volume. I made special gloves for it.  Now check it out! It's logging time!  BUBBLEGUM: I'll set the clock back now. Now I'll push the time-travel button.  BOTH: Aah!  JAKE: Eh, it's not really time travel, though. You just, you know, moved their stuff around. You didn't really manipulate time. Ice king's done it better before with magic. Well, I enjoyed your presentation very much, princess. Thank you for inviting me. BUBBLEGUM: No! For all intents and purposes, they traveled back to an earlier point in their time. JAKE: Eh, I guess, but not really. I mean, ice king did it for real. Guy pulled his fiancÃ©e out of time from a thousand years ago using magic. Hey, time, where's my fiancÃ©e, am I right?  JAKE:  BUBBLEGUM: Jake, don't deny my science! This is a time-travel machine. Hyah! Take me back to when my ex-boyfriend Brad loved me!  BUBBLEGUM: Lsp. What? BUBBLEGUM: Lsp, that's not how it works. It can only rearrange your molecules into a previously logged formation, and you need these gloves. Give them to me. BUBBLEGUM: No. You witch. Give them to me now! BUBBLEGUM: No, I'm sorry, but you need to pull yourself -- you skunk! BUBBLEGUM: Hey! You skunk! You skunk! You pretty skunk! You don't know heartache, with the whole candy kingdom in love with your pretty bubblegum buns! Aah!  BUBBLEGUM: Hear me, lumpy space princess, I will avoid declaring war on the entirety of lumpy space, ruled by your parents, if you apologize to me immediately! I'm sorry-y-y-y-y-y. I'm sorry you're so stupid. BOTH: Whoa!  BUBBLEGUM: Sheesh.  I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China all to myself alone  everyone in here is a loser. Nobody's as good as Brad. Oh, Brad! Why can't I get over you? Have you tried burning an effigy? That's what they do in movies. This isn't a movie, Charlie! It's real life!  Another cucumber water, your majesty?  What? Oh, I-I'm sorry for staring, but, uh, I know you. W-we used to -- everyone knows me. I'm lumpy space princess. No, uh, from high school -- w-we were lab partners. I'm Johnnie. "Ugly Johnnie"? Y-yeah, you used to call me that quite a bit. Yeah. But I can't call you that anymore. Come on. Sit up straight. Let me see them eyes. Mm. Do it. Nope. Can't call you that anymore.  So, what brings you to the candy kingdom, Johnnie? Business, uh, actually. I own my own company, bottling and distributing lumpy gas. Mm-hmm. And I'm up for a big contract, uh, here in the kingdom, which could really help my business "take off," so to speak. That's so cool. You're like your own boss or whatever. To be honest, I'm a little nervous about this meeting tomorrow. Why, Johnnie? I'm bad at talking to people. That's because you have poor posture. Really? You got to stop slouching. Now look me in the eye! Yeah, stay like that. Boy, lsp.  You sure are making me feel good about myself. You feeling good makes me feel good, Johnnie. So, where are you staying while you're in town? I'm subletting a friend's apartment. Talk is cheap, Johnnie. You should take me there.  That chair? Oh, it used to be over there, but I moved it. Johnnie, it's so nice. You've really made it your own. Thanks. Ooh! Records!  Okay, want to see something funny? Yeah. Okay.  Okay. Sit down. Okay, are you ready?  Yeah.  Okay!  It's his face, but on your body. I know! That's the joke! My friend Melissa and I came up with that.  You're smart that you get it. Boy, when this evening started, I was feeling so dump trucks, but now it's like a hundred forklifts! I feel the same way, Johnnie. Do you feel this couch?  What? 'Cause it's where you're gonna sleep!  Seriously, it's getting late, and I don't want you walking home, so I insist. I'll be in the other room, sleeping peacefully And dreaming about you. Johnnie! Thank you for everything. Johnnie. Go to bed already. You have a big day tomorrow. Good night.  Rise and shine! I hope you like pancakes, 'cause I got Oh. I guess she'll be the one who got away. Looking for someone? You're still here! 'Course I am. Now make me some breakfast. Okay, Johnnie, good luck at your meeting, and remember, I'll be right over there sending you good vibes while you're wowing princess bubblegum.  Sending you good vibes. Yo. Why are you so confident, man? Aren't you nervous to meet the princess? Nope. My g.F. Is back at my place, sending me good vibes.  Johnnie's friend has so many movie channels. Ha-ha! That movie was so dumb. Oh, poop! Johnnie's meeting! Wonder how it went.  Johnnie!  Oh, Johnnie, you're home! How'd it go?! Oh, don't keep me in suspense, Johnnie! I did it, babe! I landed the sale! Johnnie, that's wonderful! And I couldn't have done it without you. I know! And here's the best part -- she wants me back at the castle tonight to go over the contracts during a royal dinner. Oh, my glob! It's gonna be so nice to have dinner inside the castle. It's been awhile. Oh. No. I-it's a business meeting, not social -- just me and the princess, I'm afraid. What?! Lsp? So, bubblegum thinks she can horn in on my territory, sip from my soup after I cut all the onions? Yo, think again, tranch. Who -- who are you talking to? BUBBLEGUM: So, how are you enjoying your time in the candy kingdom? Oh, it's just great. I met this amazing purple girl at the candy tavern. BUBBLEGUM: That's wonderful, Johnnie. Now, tell me Oh, Johnnie. "Ugly Johnnie." Through my tender love, you have metamorphed into beautiful Johnnie butterfly.  Every relationship, I gamble with my heart. I go all-in because the payoff is true love. I see you when I close my eyes. And thinking of you makes my mind feel light. All my problems fade away, and I can't help smiling.  To let someone you love go into the arms of another takes a big person. I don't know if I can be that big. Aah. Aah. BUBBLEGUM:  We're under attack! Can I help? BUBBLEGUM: No, hide yourself beneath the tablecloth. There's cyanide-laced gum under the table. Chew it if you hear raiders break down the door. Okay. Hi, Johnnie.  What are you doing here? I'm going to time-travel you back to when we first met at the tavern, back to when you loved me, so we can have a second chance. What?  Aah! BUBBLEGUM: Manfried, where are the banana guards?! Take a chill pill, princess. I handled it. BUBBLEGUM: What did you handle? You know. Someone drove their car in the door, but no one was driving, and it exploded, so I handled it. BUBBLEGUM: Mm.  Don't chew it, don't chew it, don't chew it!   I'd love to get you  Johnnie? Come on. Sit up straight. Let me see them eyes.  Uh BUBBLEGUM: He's not here.  What? But I sent him back. BUBBLEGUM: The sphere would've had to log his molecules before you engaged the time-travel function. Well, then where is he? BUBBLEGUM: I don't know.  Then if he's gone, can you send me back to before I met him so I won't have to remember this heartache?! BUBBLEGUM: If that's what you want. Do it. Do it!  You witch! Give me them to -- what? What? Where are we? BUBBLEGUM: You asked me to use this. Don't touch me! You pretty skunk! You don't know heartache, with the whole candy kingdom in love with your bubblegum buns! BUBBLEGUM:  Yo!  Check, check, one, two! Hey. I'm rap bear. I can rapLike that. Ha-ha! I'm back. It's a battle of rhymes I'm gonna do it this time I'm rap bear my raps are mystical  Quantum physics! Whoo!  Yeah, yeah! JAKE: Boo! That was pre-written! It's so obvious. Take him out, finn! FINN: Off Nope. FINN: Off the dome. Here we go. Uh! I'm-a start it now I'm-a battle now we gonna make a rhyme so I can rap this time I rap for mill-I-ons sesquipedalians Yeah, that was tight. FINN: Whoo!  FINN: Huh? Rap bear, what's wrong, man? How can I be rap bear if I'm not the best? FINN: No way! You are the best. Going up against you was a dream come true. I look up to you, man. You're like -- you're like my hero, rap bear. JAKE: Awesome.  Thank you, fan.  I thought Billy was your hero. FINN: Yeah, but Billy's dead, so Billy.  Ha-ha! Check out these dummies. FINN: Ha-ha! Yeah! You're awesome, Billy! Ha-ha!  You're gonna pay for this, Billy! D'oh! Aah! FINN: Sick.  Billy! I love rap music, but only when it's good rap. Finn! Finn! Finn. FINN: Huh? Who that? I'm canyon, Billy's ex-girlfriend. FINN: Say what?! That's so weird. I was just -- party pat was just like -- JAKE: What's going on here? Who's that? FINN: This is Billy's ex-girlfriend. JAKE: His special lady? No, his ex-girlfriend. JAKE: Aw, man, I'm sorry. Well, I hope you guys get back together. Whoooooop! FINN: Jake's still in denial about Billy. Billy and I broke up four years ago, but I held on to this. FINN:  Billy's loincloth! After Billy died, I couldn't keep it in my place anymore. I heard you guys were friends, so when I saw your name on the rap-battle flier, I thought it would be cool to bring it to you.  Oh, that's some smelly. FINN: Thank you, canyon. I guess I've been in denial, too. Have you been back to Billy's crack? No. I can't. FINN: It's time to go see Billy's crack. Shouldn't Jake be here? FINN: He needs more time. This would mess him up too much.  Fairies! Ohh, they've infested the place. Okay, you guys, out! This is Billy's crack. Billy got aced by the lich. We had dibs on the crack, so beat it! FINN: I'll dib up your brains if you don't respect the mems of Billy. Flimsy threats! Like a tiny blade of grass in a maelstrom, you are. That storm is me, Jordan, lord of the fairies! I ain't afraid of you or this big --  You think you can chump me like that? This breeze feels great, doofus!  All right. FINN: Laters. Um, so, canyon, why did you and Billy break up? Huh? Oh. Well, I loved Billy, and I believed in him, but then Billy stopped believing, and that jammed up our whole deal -- being a top-tier, red-belt power couple. After awhile, all he did was watch movies and play video games. Pretty lame, right? So I bailed. FINN: Even heroes have slumps, bro. Yeah, I know. I heard he was making a comeback, too. What a weird world. Hyah!  Billy! What the FINN: What is it? It looks like Billy's bucket list. FINN: Whoa! Let me see!  Hmm. Looks like he got to most of these. He sure lived a full life. Okay, here's one. Wait. "Tell finn that thing." What the butt is that? I don't know. FINN: Okay, that's gonna bother me forever. Well -- well, here's one more. We should do it for Billy. What's that? Are you sure you're okay? FINN: Aaaaaaaahh! FINN: Holy shram! Whoo!  That was awesome, finn. You know, you remind me of Billy when he was young. FINN: Whoa. So, can I see you sometime? I have a feeling our paths will cross again. Take care, finn. FINN:  "Take canyon on one last ride." Whoops. Unh. What? Another item? You sneaky Billy. "Lie on my back in the ocean." Cool.  Why the ocean, Billy?!  Okay, finn, don't think about your fear. Just jump in there like it's no biggie. Do it for Billy. For Billy! I'm afraid. I'm afraid! Oh, dang. Here he comes! Here comes the fear feaster!  Way to go, finn the coward. Still afraid of the ocean, eh?  You should just give up! You're not a hero. You're a wimp-o! A cringing, cowardly --  Hey, where you going? Fool, I come with. Ha-ha! I'm gonna nosh on your insecurities. Then I'll -- I'll squat on your hopes. So, now what, little boy? Huh? Uh, hey, man, don't do anything stupid. Hey! You're too chicken to face your fears with open eyes? This stank is cheating! FINN: This stank is for Billy.  No! FINN: Aah!  Aaaaaaaaaaahh!  For Billy! Wake up. Wake up! FINN: FINN:  Huh? Whoa! No mortal blade can harm -- what?!  FINN: Was that you, or me? Huh? Hey. Hey. I-I'm doing it!  I'm not afraid of the ocean anymore! I'm doing it, Billy. Billy!  You finished my list. Now I can rest like a great hero. Thank you, finn. FINN: You're welcome. Canyon helped, too. Tell canyon I watch her sleep. Man, love is weird, finn. FINN: I know. Is that the thing you wanted to tell me? No. Goodbye. FINN: Wait. Billy! What? FINN: What's the thing you wanted to tell me? Oh, uh, you must go to the citadel. That's where you father is. FINN: Joshua's not alive. Me and Jake buried him behind the -- not Joshua! Your other dad -- dad the human. FINN: What? Your father, finn. He's alive.  He's alive.  


     - Yah! -  Whoo, swords! Yeah, swords! Swords! Whoo! Oh, men and their swords. You boys stop horsing around with my apples. BOTH: Aw, Tree Trunks.

Apple pie. - Don't let him eat it all! -  Now, you boys behave yourselves and sit down. Ohh! Shoo, fly! Get off my apple pie! Ugh! A fly landed on my pie. That's no good. Bye-bye. Why are you throwing the pie away?! BOTH: Ugh! Flies wanted it, they can have it.  Anyways, don't y'all worry, 'cause a new pie's coming in a wag of a lamby's tail. BOTH: New pie? Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Pie! Yeah! Here ya are. - Whoa! Come on. Go ahead.  What'd ya think? Best apple pie ever! Oh, Jake. Thank you, but that isn't the best apple pie. What are you talking about, Tree Trunks? What could be better than your apple pie? You ate all the pie. Finn, what would you do if you could do anything? Anything? Well, l'd catch a shooting star and travel to outer space and fight space monsters. l'd carve my face on the moon so the moon would look like my face. What would you do, Tree Trunks? l would go pick an apple. Lame.  l-l'm sorry. l-l mean, it's just that you pick apples every day. This apple ain't like the apples that l pick. They say it's the apple of apples, rarest kind of all. Legends call it the crystal gem apple. Ugh! - That sounds awesome! - Where is it? l heard that it grows in the deepest end of the evil dark forest. Whoo! Tree Trunks, you got to go pick that apple. Yeah! What? Me? Oh, no. l'm just a cute little elephant. l'm not cut out for adventuring. Tree Trunks, this is your dream. Think about eating that apple with your own mouth. Or your trunk! lmagine the flavor. And your satisfied face! Really? You think l can handle the scary dark forest? Yeah! And we'll help you. We love you, Tree Trunks. Okay, l'll do it. Call me Adventurer Tree Trunk. Yeah! Tree Trunks! l love being so high up from the ground.  Psst. l could take you even higher on my shoulders, Tree Trunks. No, Jake. She has a weak heart. Oh, yeah. Ew! Why is this ground all squishy? Whatever it is, l'm liking it! Oh, yeah! l want to try. Okay. l'm cool with letting you do whatever you want.  lt's like some cookie dough.  Oh. Hello, there. Huh? Uh, Tree Trunks, stay away from that. BOTH: Aah! Aah! Unh! Ugh! You're gonna get it, wall of flesh! Yuh! Yuh! Yuh! Yuh! Yuh! Yuh! Yu-u-u-h! An eye. And a mouth. Well, l think l've got the perfect thing for him or her. Stickers! -  Careful, Tree Trunks. This thing is evil. Here's a rainbow sticker.  And here's a scratch-and-sniff sticker, smells just like a pickle. Oh. And this one's a holographic unicorn. But it doesn't have a horn. Oh! Now, what you doin'? Huh? Tree Trunks! You better stay in that tree, baby! Tree Trunks, were you putting stickers on that evil monster? - Yes. l-l thought it needed some tender love and affection. Oh! What a pretty butterfly.  Tree Trunks?  Jake, l just realized that Tree Trunks is old and bonkers. We can't take her through that evil dark forest. Ah, she'll be fine. Everything's fine. - But the monsters. - lt's fine. lt's fine! Are you sure? 'Cause she has zero adventurer training. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. lt's fine. She'll be fine. l-l-lt's fine. lt's fine. lt's fine.  Maybe it ls fine. Tree Trunks? Where'd she go? FlNN: Tree Trunks? TREE TRUNKS:  Oh!  We got to find her, Jake. Tree Trunks! Where are you, Tree Trunks? And here's your teacup, and here's my teacup. BOTH: Tree Trunks?  And here's your sandwich. -  Oops, you dropped it. Tree Trunks! Run! Oh, hey, Finn. Hyah! Time to call your mamas, evil signposts. Patience, boys. There's enough tea for everyone.  No! Oh, what a nice hug.  l'm not hugging you!  l'm trying to  save your life!  There's too many! Finn?! Oh, Finn. That tea party was crumbier than a big ol' biscuit. Aah! Tree Trunks, l'm all jacked up because of you. Look at my jacked-up face! Are you mad at me?  No. l'm not mad at you. You're too supercute for me to be mad at you. And you're a topnotch adventurer. Now, let's go find and eat the heck out of that crystal gem apple together.  Dang it! You go fight. l'll keep Tree Trunks out of trouble. Awesome!  Uh, Jake, l think Finn's getting jacked up again. Yeah, Finn can handle it. He's 1 2. l think l know a way to help him out. Uh, you should stay here, Tree Trunks. But Finn said l was a topnotch adventurer. And my adventurous instincts tell me to seduce that tentacled critter with my womanly charms and elephant prowess. Uh, no way.  Huh?! What are you doing here, Tree Trunks? Wha! Ugh! l'm helping you by tempting this guy with  my body. lt's not a guy, Tree Trunks! lt's a snake-armed ruby brain beast. Even brain beasts get lonely, Finn. Jake, you were supposed to watch her. She got past me, man. l tried to stop her, but she overpowered me. Get her out of here! Huh?! Uh-oh!  Da da da-da da da  Finn! Kill it! l can't find its magic-gem weak spot. FlNN: Oh! There it is.  l did it! l helped! l'm the sexiest adventurer in the world. Tree Trunks, you're not an adventurer! You nearly got yourself killed -- again! Do you want to die, Tree Trunks?! ls that what you think adventurers do -- die and make all their friends feel terrible 'cause they couldn't save you?!  Whoa, man. l-l'm going home now. Tree Trunks Tree Trunks! Don't follow me! Oh, Finn, you shouldn't yell at cuties that just want to help you. Ohh! Man, l feel horrible. l was only yelling because l care about her safety. That's what happens when you care too much, dude.  BOTH:  Tree Trunks! Finn! l found the crystal gem apple.  Whoo-hoo! You're the man, Tree Trunks. Tree Trunks, l'm a huge butt guy for getting mad at you. l'm a huge fart. l was only upset because l love you and l don't wanna see you get hurt. That's precious, Finn. And l'll accept your apology if you let me kiss your cheek. Uh l don't -- l don't know. l -- Whoa. Let her kiss your cheek, man. lt's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  Whoa! BOTH: Huh? Let her kiss your cheek, man. lt's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Uh l don't know. A crystal guardian! Tree Trunks, stay out of the monster battle this time. l don't want you getting hurt. All right. l promise l will. Radical! Back off, you! Back off, you! Stop copying me!  Stop copying me!  Aaaaaah!  Aaaah!  Ow! Finn!  Ohh! Ow! He's copying everything we do. Hey, it's my butterfly friend. That's precious.  Da da-da da da da da Da da-da da da da da  Whoo! Shake it, Tree Trunks! Whoo! Shake it, Tree Trunks!  Da da-da da da da  Jam clam! Let's beat it up while it's copying Tree Trunks. BOTH: Ya-a-a-a-h! Oh, crud. This is barf, dude. Oh, man! l'm a total moron. We got to fight this one Tree Trunks-style. l'll get the makeup!  Hey, crystal guardian! Are you okay with Tree Trunks taking a bite of that apple? - l'm okay with it. - l'm okay with it. - And l'm stupid. - And l'm stupid.  You heard the guardian, T.T. Bite that thing. Okay!  Whoo! How's it taste, Tree Trunks? Yeah, how is it?

It's just the air smells bad from your magic tricks, and now I feel sad. I left all my scented candles at the castle. They'd really cut through the magic stink. Just go back to the Fire Kingdom and get them -- Problem solved.  Then I'll have to see my dad. I'm still mad at him for imprisoning me in that lantern. So unfair!  Uh we can go get them. Really? That would be really nice. But don't let my pops see you. I don't want his majesty thinking I need anything from him.  It ain't me!  - ALL: Whoa!  Oh!  Flambo!

Don't disrespect my lady! I say it as a compliment! Like it reminds me of my grandma. I love my grandma. HISSING VOICE: No one come-s-s-s here.  Not since Flame Princess-s-s fled the castle. Now gues-s-s what we're gonna kill Flame King with.  A conspirator with a hiss voice! FEMALE VOICE: How about water? HISSING VOICE: Even wors-s-e! We'll use ic-c-e! And a conspirator with an untied shoe! FEMALE VOICE: Ice? Why ice? 'Cause it's more painful, you s-s-impleton! Cold as ic-c-e fall-s-s! A perfect death for The Flame King! -  -  Did you hear that? -  - Jake, come on! We got to stop those guys from killing Flame Princess' dad! Right, right. Dirt bags! Where'd they go? Hey, is that new? - Yeah, I think it is. - Yes, it is new. Hmm, what do you guys think of this painting? I like it. Hey, is this one of those paintings where the eyes follow you?  Hmm. Hmm. Come on, let's get outta here. I don't wanna miss snack time. - Snacks! - Snacks! Snacks! ALL: Snacks! Snacks! Snacks! Snacks!  Now what? HISSING VOICE: and most unnatural murder-s-s. Hear that?

We must follow the voice! HISSING VOICE: To die, to s-sleep, to s-sleep, perchance to dream Which way is the hiss voice coming from? Aye, there's the rub, for in that s-sleep of death This way! HISSING VOICE: what dream-s-s may come. Which way? HISSING VOICE: I s-seem to be s-saying a lot about our s-super-s-secret plan To the left! You!  BOTH: You! You! You! BOTH: Double you! Double you! I don't think it's them. BOTH: Double you! Double you! Whoa!  Jake! I'm okay! I think I hear that hissing voice down this way! Whoa!  Why didn't you catch me? - Oops! Tell me next time. I can't think in the future. Vent ahead. Jake, I want to see.  22. - No hissing. - No untied shoe. Vent.  This needs something more! Yes!  Yes! That's the  stuff! Whoa! It's him!  Hmm? My bluebies!  You buffoon! Where's your partner with the untied shoe? What partner? What are you blueberries  talking about? Give it up, man! I heard your hiss voice! I don't have a  voice! There's a  snake on your shoulder! - What? -  Aah! - Hmm. -  Suffering  succotash! Now to chop you two big blueberries into small, bite-sized blueberries!  Shakespeare. Five minutes to curtain, everyone! Five minutes! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!  Ooh!  Oh! Pfft! Actors! What's going on with the costumes? This is a theater troupe! We're getting ready to perform for the king! Everyone in the kingdom shall be in attendance! Of course, you know all this, being fellow actors from the exact same troupe. I have an idea. We'll go onstage, act like two conspirators. You will have one shoe untied, I will talk with a hiss voice. We'll talk about how we want to kill the king. As we do this, we'll study the faces of the audience and look for guilty reactions. - That's brilliant! - Thanks! It's an original idea by me.  Ahem! Hey, conspirator! Hey, co-conspirator! Let's talk about how we're gonna kill the king! Shh! S-Somebody might hear our evil plot! Man, I am so lost. Psst! The audience! Uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh  You think that's one of them? Maybe. Let's keep going. So, what are you packing? Water, man -- enough of it to put out the king's fire! Uh, uh hmm.  I think he's starting to crack. Water? You know what's even more painful? If we pour ice in his ear! That's how we'll kill The Flame King! Pbht! Kill The Flame King? This is treason disguised as a play! Guards, seize them! What?! No!  Please! We were trying to warn you about assassins! Hmm. Search them!  Huh?  Sire, it's your daughter's scented candles! - I-I-I - Sickos! Off with their heads! - Whoa, what?! -  No, please! S-Stay s-still. "S-Still"?  Untied shoelace?  It's them! S-So long, s-suckers! Naked babies, naked babies, naked babies! Naked babies, naked babies, naked babies!  Naked babies, naked babies, naked babies!  We found 'em! The executioners are the real king-killers! S-Silence! Wait, wait, wait that voice. Guards, take off their hoods! Aah! My identity! -  - Ugh!  Furnius and Torcho! Hello uncle!  Arrest the executioners!  Hmm I thought I had you two extinguished. You cannot quench the flame-s-s-s of revenge! You snuffed out our father to become king! FLAME KING: Oh, yeah ha ha. Take them to the punishment room! I'll des-s-troy all of you - Release me! - with ic-c-c-e! Wait, so you -- you extinguished their dad? Mm-hmm. And everyone is evil here?  Mm-hmm -- all evil. Thenis Flame Princess evil? Or maybe chaotic neutral? She's evil. Okay so your daughter's evil -- we've established that. But do you think if a good guy really liked her could he change her to good? Hmm, well, there'd be penalties to her experience if she acted out of alignment, but yes. Someone could change her. Change her to good?  Aww!  Evil, evil, evil, evil. Evil, evil, evil evil! Aah!    


    Our secret mission to capture the lce King is under way, though l probably shouldn't say stuff like that out loud.  Who is it? Zap! Zap! Zap! Zap! Zap! Zap! Zap! Oh, someone left me a gift.

Yeah, this place is deserted, except for that guy. lch bin hier, Finn. lt's me, der Princess. Did you bring him? - Sure did.  So, what did the lce King do to --  No time! Now, quickly, with me!  Ttublaw! What's the password?  You got me! BOTH: Secret door! This stairway leads to the dungeon where we'll toss that lousy lce King! What awful thing did he do to get tossed in there?  He didn't do anything -- not a thing. What? lt's a long story, Finn. You see, the lce King -- Princess Bubblegum, you're needed at once in the grand hall. No! l need more time! Gosh, l'm sorry. All right, all right. l have to go. You two just guard the lce King until l return. And be prepared to make him howl with pain. You got it, Princess!  Oh, this is a total rook! Settle down, prisoner! We got to record your belonging. One magical crown.  Probably stolen. l didn't steal it! l made that item -- made it with the magic that l stole! So hand it over or l'll strike menacing poses at you! Cool it, inmate!  Aah! Aah! These bars can't hold me forever! Hey, there's only like two of them. You fools have no business guarding prisoners. Oh, yeah? Well, how about these helmets we found? And we got the oculus of rehabilitation! Huh?  Be better! And the shelf of penitence!  l'm sorry. l'm so sorry. How about you just hand me my crown? l'll create some ice bars. Okay! No, Jake! lt's a trick! l'm toying with you  psychologlcally!  FlNN: Finished! So, what am l being charged with? Um Five counts of jerketeering. Ha! Yeah. What does it matter? Gah! Of course it matters! The way it works is, first, l transgress your meaningless rules, and then you maliciously persecute me! That makes sense. You do bad stuff, l punish you. Fool! You have disrupted that order for -- Are you ready for this? l have committed no recent crime! Really? Um  l'm rockin' your world view! Jake, he ls starting to convince me we're doing a bad thing! Dude  be calmed by my saliva and think of all the terrible things he's done. Yeah. Yeah, you're still a jerk that deserves to be in jail! Oh, yeah? You know who really deserves to be in jail? l will show you the true jerks! Behold!  Uh, it's too dark. Behold!  Behold! Behold the true jerks! The jerks is us? Jake, am l going crazy? lt seems like the lce King is right about this. But if he's in the right, then that means we're in The Candy Kingdom! No. lt means much, much worse. On your feet! ls it time for my hour in the yard, boss? No. We're letting you go. We decided that it's wrong to imprison you. This is a trick, huh? Get out of here before l change my mind! There must be someone waiting outside to beat me. Ooh, is that my crown over there?  l'm glad that's all taken care of. No Not quite yet. Aw! Sorry, but since we're the bad guys this time, we got to go to jail. This sucks. Hey, get out of my room! Y-you're still here?! J-just get out of here, man! So You're really breaking me out? Like l said, it's wrong to imprison you. You mean, you believe me? Oh, can it be? Has all the hatred between us somehow transmuted into something more? A friendship? A best friendship? Knucks!  Slaps in disgust, eh? Ooh, let's call them ''Slappy D's!'' Okay, see you later, my bosoms! l am no man's bosom. Cast ''detect secret door!'' Success!  Sorry for the delay. Man, there are a lot of secret doors around here. And now, lce King, prepare to howl with Pain? Wow, she's so proud we did the right thing that she almost looks enraged. Where is the lce King? Finally, freedom and friends forever! What have you done?!  What have we done? l'll show you! Achoo! Aah! Yep, even ol' Starchie's sick. A plague of freezer-burn flu. lce King did this?! Well Yes and no. lt happened three days ago.  Hey, Princess, check out my new trick! lt's snowing! lt's snowing for you! PRlNCESS BUBBLEGUM: We don't think he was trylng to spread disease. But soon, the entire Kingdom was infected by his beard flakes. Through my research, l quickly discovered that the only way to cure my people was to obtain the pained howls of the lce King himself. But when l pleaded with him directly Please, l beseech your aid in the name of common decency! So, let me get this straight. You're hitting on me. No!  l think l heard the word ''virile'' in there. Oh, she's definitely hitting on me. No!  Begone, you biddies! He had his chance to help, and he did nothing! Oh, my gosh. She came to me this time! l had no choice but to try and take his wails by force. By getting us to beat the tar out of him? l can't just beat up the lce King for nothing. That's against my alignment. l know! l know! You're right!  But l'll get him to give up those howls voluntarlly. l swear it. Oh, thank you, Finn! l  Shhhh. Dude, how are we gonna get those howls? Oh, l've got a plan to trick him, but you won't like it. That sounds ominous. l don't like it! lce King, come forth! lCE KlNG: l'm coming forth! ls that the voice of friendship l hear? So, are you fellas ready for game night? Game night? Well, that's weird. What? Why? You do know how friends act, right? You've had friends before. Uhyes? Yeah, so you know how friends are always howling in pain for each other. Yeah. Right! Everyone knows that.  Will you howl for me, pal? Ooh, of course, friend. Oh!  Sorry! Oh, l've got the sillies. l couldn't possibly howl without giggling uncontrollably. l'm just so giddy about you being here.  l'm a banana!  Don't slip on me! We're out of options. Let's just beat it out of him! No, Jake, we -- Wait a sec. There's a bug on you, friend. Smack!  Biscuits! Now's my chance! You know, l carved these game pieces from my own teeth. FlNN: Boohoo, boohoo, boohoo. Huh? Crying? Boohoo. You hit me, lce King. l don't think l could live anymore, knowing my best bosom hit me. l was only saving you from poo poo palms. l'm dying because l know you care not for me. Bleh. No! My -- my bosom! What have l done?! My friend! My only friend! Hey, what about me? Why?! Why?! Starchie's feelin' healthy again -- a bit too healthy, if you ask me.  They're all getting better. Finn and Jake did it!   Oh, well. Gunter, dispose of Finn's carcass. Harrumph! Good job! Those wails must have reached all the way back to -- Did you see how fast he dropped my lifeless body? That's just mean. Finn, if l came across your lifeless body, l'd clasp you dramatically for a kajillion years. Thanks, man. Hey, why wait? Play dead, Finn. Why?!  Why?!  Why?! BOTH: Adventure Time!

I like the can. Hmm. I'd hate it if my kids didn't ever see each other Or if Viola shoved Jake Jr. Down a dream hole. I don't know. Jermaine's always been kind of a dream hole. Whoa. We're all getting older. We should go see him now, or we might regret it. Eh. It's not a great time just this minute. Trying to figure this deal out. Whoa! Okay. Let's go see Jermaine. There's a lot more demons here than I remember. Huh. Yeah. The only constant is change, bro. I want my yoyo! Yo yo! That's rude, dude! Give back my cup! Huh? Bring me my cup, or I'll skull cup you! Yipe! Jake! Whoa! Oh, you guys really came. Quick! Get behind the salt barrier! They can't cross the circle. It's made from dad's old shaman-blessed, sage-infused salt. Return my cup! Return my cup!

"Open, ya sissy!" Yeah, flip the tape, I know. "Good times." Right. Hey! I'm booboo sousa! You want to be friends? We been friends, booboo. You're slippin', Jerm. No, I'm not. You're gonna miss that alarm one day, and I'm gonna eat you from the bottom up so you can watch me while I eat you. Then, in my triumph, I will retrieve the poster your dad stole from me! Bryce, I put the poster right there. You're still mad about that? How dare you use tacks on my poster! You're gonna get it, man! You know, Bryce, I would've let you and your poster go years ago if you'd stop it with all that "from the bottom up" talk. You would? Yeah, man. I don't want to flip that tape all day! That's you and Joshua beef 'cause you wouldn't stop breaking in for that poster. Well, come on, man. Let's be bros. No way, you psycho. I ain't never gonna trust you after all that stuff you said.

Dang, dude, this fried rice destroys! How'd you get all this flavor? Sesame oil and salt. Salt is one of the five taste sensations. Sweet, sour, bitter, umami, and salty. I guess I'm just used to bitter. That's weird. I haven't had salt in like five years. Hold on. Epsilon, eucradies, dernesto, quillduct Uh, where'd you get the salt from, Jake?

Guys, guys, guys! This whole place is burning down! So if you're done being angry bonkers, let's work together! Jermaine? You gonna leave me hanging, bro? Let it burn. Huh? But all of dad's stuff! No. I think it's all right. The salt line got broken. Where'd all the d's go? Maybe with their stuff gone, they had no reason to stay. Oh, no! The tape! Open! I got my poster! Booboo sousa I ate his stupid face off. It was sick. Ugh. Do you even know what you sound like when you talk like that? I sound cool. If that's what you think. That's what I know. Dang.

We're like two normal jelly beans sitting at the bottom of the jar, floating in a sea of olives, waiting for somebody to guess how many jelly beans are in the jar, which I mentioned. I don't think I understand. Just look into my eyes and know that everything is okay. Are you feeling normal yet? Okay.  See that? We're normal, just like the normal people are. Oh.

    Aaaaaaaah!  Alouette, gentille alouette Alouette, je te plumerai Je te plumerai, Je te plumerai Alouette Huh, I guess you do know all the words. Anyway, start the next video, Beemo. We got to crack the code on the Ice King's evil secret tapes!  Brrr! You guys cold? Yeah, it's kinda chilly in here.  What's on those tapes? I can kind of make it out. Dang it, Beemo, just turn to your right a little. Ugh! By the power of ice, I want your cup of cocoa to fall over!  Yes! Now turn and pick it up. Yes. Yes.  That's me? They're watching my secret tapes?!  And they're cozy! I'll show them. This snowman looks pretty good. Pretty darn good.   Wenk. Could / have five more minutes, please ?  I think I can break the code, Finn. Really? Yes, I have detected a noticeable pattern in the tears of sadness that fall from the Ice King's eyeballs. His tears drop at an equal rate until the 13th tear, when the right side drops two tears instead of one. - Whoa. - This is so fascinating. The 13th letter of the alphabet is if I print the letter "m" every time Ice King says an "m" word it looks like this. Oh, my glob, Jake. ls this it? Could this be the Ice King's evil secret? What does it mean?! Some of you won't survive this. You'll melt or split in half or your head will fall off. But that's fine, because you're made of snow. Only one thing matters today -- getting into that tree house, getting my tapes back, and beating up Finn and Jake! Maybe Beemo. Yeah, Beemo, too. Who's with me?  Hey, Why are you guys So quiet? Are you mad? Oh, that's right, you're not alive yet. My bad.  Give me my tapes back. No, man! I know you've got evil secrets on these, and we're gonna find them! Snowmen, attack!  ICE KING: Aah! Crup, Jake! We got to unravel these evil secrets at warp crazy! Good morning. You're watching the evening news. There's been an unfortunate event. Let's go talk to some witnesses. Princess, what is your name? Please, let me go home! So, Princess Please-let-me-go-home, tell me, what was it like to experience this tragedy? What? I can-- I don't, uh, uh Yeah, we're on air, honey, so spit it out. I I don't know what you're talking about. Obviously traumatized and in a state of shock. Let's go ask somebody else something. Upside-down Princess, do you think things will change politically because of today's events? You're really frightening me! Well, there you have it, folks. People are very upset that Gunter tried to eat Ice King's socks. Very Upset! That's why Gunter has to stay in the corner. Weird. -  He's sneaking in through the chimney!  Ah, the element of surprise. Aw, geez, I'm filthy.  Well, now I'm cleaner, but I'm also nakeder. Ooh! Mmm.  Just what I need.  Come on, come on.  Daddy, why did you eat my fries'? I bought them. They were mine But you ate them You ate my fries And I cried But you didn't see me cry Daddy, do you even love me? Well, I wish you would show it 'cause I wouldn't know it  - Yeesh!  They wouldn't be in a fruit bowl! Ooh! Well, look at you with your nose shining so bright! You're so unique!  I'll name you "Red Nose" and make you leader of the pack!  Well, now you look boring. If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.  Now give me my evil tapes back! They're supposed to be buried in the ground! BOTH:  Snow goons! - Oh, no! - Don't worry, Beemo. Aah! Finn, there's one more tape! Play it! His evil secret must be on that tape! No, Beemo, please don't play it! Hello, my name is Simon Petrikov. I am recording this tape so that people will know my story. Oh, no! Turn it off, Beemo! Turn it off! I was studying to be an antiquarian of ancient artifacts. Now I never believed in the supernatural stuff myself, just had a fascination with superstitions. But everything changed when I came into contact with this item. BOTH: The Ice King! After purchasing this crown from an old dock worker in northern Scandinavia, I brought it home and excitedly showed my fiancee, Betty. I jokingly put it on my head, just for a laugh or something, and that's when it started the visions. I fought with them, shouted at them until I realized it wasn't real! It was the crown! I quickly took it off and saw my fiancÃ©e in front of me, looking at me with such contempt! What had I said? What had I done when I wore this crown? All I know is, I never saw Betty again. Since then, I now see the visions always, whether or not I wear the crown. They tell me the secrets the secrets of the ice and snow, that the power of the crown will save me with its frost. I don't yet know what this means As you can see, my skin is beginning to turn blue, my body temperature has been lowering at a supernatural rate, to what is now about 30 degrees celsius. I don't know when it will end. I'm really scared I know my mind is changing, but I'm already too far gone to know what to do. I want people to know that if I do things, if -- if I do things that hurt anyone, please, please forgive me! Just watch over me until I can find my way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity! And then maybe Betty, my princess maybe you will love me again.  Please love me again, Betty!  Drama bomb!  Now you know my secret! You know that I used to wear glasses!  Maybe kidnapping Wildberry Princess will cheer me up. Wait, Ice King. Beemo, eject tape, please. Here, Ice King. What's this? You're giving me a gift? No! It's Well, these belong to you. But it's not even my birthday! Oh, this is so exciting! Video tapes! You know, I had a bunch of these once, but I threw them away. This is great, Finn. Thank you. It's from me, too. Oh, I have presents for you guys, too! Here, it's a small pine tree. I chopped it down in one fell swoop. And this is for you. Uh, thanks. Oh, isn't this fun? We're exchanging presents. We're wearing silly clothes. There's snow everywhere. Let's do this every day! Uh How about once a year?  Okay. That sounds good. SHELBY: And so it was decided, that once every year, when the weather got chilly, that Finn, Jake, the Ice King, Beemo, Princess Bubblegum, Marceline the Vampire Queen, Cinnamon Bun, Peppermint Butler, Phil, a candy cane man, one of the Gumdrop Girls, Lady Rainicorn, Lumpy Space Princess, that guy, the other guy, a pig, Tree Trunks, a two-headed duck, the old crazy Tart Toter, the punch bowl, a booger, and Gunter would get together while wearing really big sweaters and watch videos on the floor next to a fire to celebrate the day when Finn and Jake had a Ã¯Â¬Âeeting moment of empathy for the biggest weirdo in Ooo. It was a miracle. Good night.  Come along with me And the butterflies and bees We can wander through the forest I'  And do so as we please Come along with me To a cliff under a tree  


  Man, birthday-holiday overlap. That's some tough luck. Everyone's all jollied-out when it's your turn for jollies. Well You know, it's not actually the holidays. Plus, BMO wasn't actually even really born. Well, I suppose. But you don't got to be so technical about it. Listen, all I'm saying is we Hello? Hey, it's me. Is there a big rainbow over your house right now, spelling out "Happy birthday, BMO"? No. Actually, it's snowing like crazy. Okay, that's what I was afraid of. Peppermint Butler spilled grape juice on my experimental weather machine, and now it's going kablooey. I got to stay here and fix this thing. Tell BMO I'm sorry I missed the party. That's okay. BMO doesn't care any BMO only cares about one special guest. Moe! Hooray! Moe is coming! And he brought me a special surprise for my birthday! Moe is the smartest man in the world. He's way smarter than you and you and you, too, Jake and you're the smartest guy I know. Hey, thanks. And he knows everything about robots. He built me, and he built himself, and all the other MOs. He's so smart! I bet he could even fix NEPTR. What? What's wrong with me? Oh, boy, oh, boy. He's here! Hooray! Hooray! Oh. You are not Moe. Why, of course I am, BMO. Oh, okay. Hey, Moe! New haircut? Whoa, Moe! What happened to your body? Oh, oh! Oh, that old thing? She conked out on me months ago. I guess I don't make 'em like I used to. Not like little BMO here. You got all my love and affection. Thanks! Well, we made a cake. We weren't sure if you eat, but BMO insisted. Eating helps me grow! Oh! Well, er, uh When in Rome. So, BMO, are you ready for your birthday surprise? Boy, howdy! For your birthday, I got you A special mission! A mission? A special mission, like a vacation. For all of us? No, no, no. A special solo mission. For NEPTR? No. It's a special rite of passage I designed just for you, BMO. A simple jaunt to the MO factory and back that's all And then you'll be a grown-up. Wow. Hmm, I don't know. Sounds kind of dangerous. Yeah, BMO's like a baby almost. Oh, don't be silly. Every other MO has done it since forever. But won't I miss Finn and Jake? Oh, sure. But don't worry. They'll be here when you get back. But Won't Finn and Jake miss me? No, that's the beauty of it. I'll be BMO while you're gone. Hooray! Hooray! - Hooray? - Hooray! Air? Are you there, air? It's me BMO. I know it's been a long time since we talked. Sorry about that. But, well, maybe if you don't want to talk, you could just listen. Moe told me if I do this thing, I'll be a grown-up, and that sounds cool, I guess. Like, if I was grown, then I could drive to the playground all by myself. And I could buy my own pacifiers at the store, if I was grown. But then, if I change, will Finn and Jake still love me? Will I still love them? Moe changed to a new body And he's still the same, I guess, sort of. But does growing up just change your body, or also your soul? Maybe I could just stay the same forever. So So! Um Yeah, it's nice to see you, Moe. Yeah, you too. Uh So, Moe, do you want to Uh Jake? Oh, hey, I'm on my way. One sec. Um, hold on, Moe. Jake, what are you doing? Finn, all this is heck of awkward without BMO Way more awkward than I thought it'd be. I think maybe I don't like old people. They make me feel like I'm gonna get old one day, too. I'm just gonna stay in this cup for a bit. I'll be out later. You can't do that, it's rude. And what about Princess Bubblegum? She's way old, and you like her. Yeah, but she listens to music. Moe probably only, like, listens to the sound of the earth decaying. Come on, you're being weird. Hey, sorry about that, Moe. Boys, I know this is new and different. I am not BMO. But I will do the best to be your friend. This is the daybreak of our lives, and we have all the time in the world to learn about each other. For now, I will be your little robot. Would you look at that beautiful snowfall. Hey, let's get out there and have some fun. I think I'm feeling better now. Oh, whoa! Hey! Hello there, BMO! Hello there, DMO. I'm here on a solo birthday mission. Oh, yes, yes, BMO, I know all about it. Moe left special instructions for you. He wants you to stand on that "x" over here. Oh, okay. Like this? DMO, what happened? Oh, this? I-it's nothing. It's just whatever. Uh, I don't know about this, DMO. Something doesn't Aah! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Ugh! Hello? Boys, look at this! This is cool, right? Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Yeah! Oh! Whoo! - Classic! - Yeah! Did you see what we did, Moe? This is horseplay! Stop it! We need to go inside and do what I want to do! Oh. O-okay. If if you want. Yeah. DMO? Hello? Anybody? The "x" door opened, and I fell through. I think something went wrong with the mission. Uh Abort mission! Unless maybe this is all part of Moe's plan. It doesn't seem like it. But maybe that's the point. Maybe the lesson is that when you are grown, you won't ever be able to tell if everything is going totally haywire, or maybe actually everything is perfectly fine. Huh? Huh? Who's there? Moe? No. It's only me BMO. BMO? Oh, thank goodness. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. Who are you? Are you a MO, too? Oh, BMO, no, no, no. I am all MOs. All MOs? Uh I don't understand. Of course not. I'm so sorry. Let me explain. Peace had reigned in mo's wondrous factory for a hundred hundred years. There was a place for every mo, and every mo was in its place. If you wanted a free hug, all you had to do was ask. No one could say no It was a rule. Until one fateful day Yesterday When a mysterious viral signal somehow breached our firewall and was broadcast throughout the factory Instructing all us MOs to do somersaults into the trash compactor all day long. That's horrible. And we've been trapped here all smushed together, ever since. That's horrible, too. How how do we get out? Well, that's why we're so glad you're here, BMO. You're the key The key to escape. Only you can save us now. Let's see. $4 off a Honey-baked ham. I don't like ham. $1 off of beets. Do beets have tannins? What is that? Oh! $4 off a honey-baked ham. Moe? Call me "Gwampa." How's your rose water? It's exactly what it says it is. So, hey, uh, gwampa, feels too quiet in here. Maybe we can hang out with NEPTR? He can rap or something.  B-b-b-bread where's my needle and thread  No! Eh, well, NEPTR is too distracting. Who wants to play video games? Oh, you have games like BMO? Let's do that, gwampa. I have one video game. It's called "Hangman." That sounds griz as nuts! Yeah, let's play hang-a-man! Coming right up. Pick a letter. Show us what you did, hangman! Pick a letter. But, ALLMO, I don't understand. How can I help? I mean, I'm just a little baby kid still - Even though it's my birthday - Happy birthday, BMO. I don't know about that, but I do know about your special mind. As the accumulation of all MOs, my computing power is unmatched. Yet still, I lack the imagination to think outside my collective programming. I can only see the world as it is. But your imagination, BMO, lets you see the world how it could be, or might sort of be like. If the two of us work together, we can think up a way out of here. I will do what I can. All right. You see that hatch over there? That hatch leads to an exit corridor. But it's locked from this side. The vent up there leads to the other side. But it's too high up. Oh. What if we use this trash to climb up to the vent? But all this trash is too small. Ah-huh! Whoa. You just blew my mind. What haven't we guessed yet? "B." "Burgess Meredith"?! I don't even know what that is! Do you boys want to play again? Boys love games. Pick a letter. Uh, I don't know, "e." Is this "Burgess Meredith" again?! Not cool! Come on, Finn, let's find a real hangman. Yuck. This room gives me the heebie-jeebies straight-up. It is the room of AMO, the first of our siblings. He, too, was special. As you were built to give love, AMO was built to receive. But he could not think outside his programming and was blinded by his need. Such is the cruel physics of love That those who crave it most will repel it and only the dang rich get richer. Well, maybe as my birthday present, I can ask Moe to fix AMO. But this is impossible. Moe went off line yesterday and has not re-logged. Our sensors would know. But he's at my house right now with Finn and Jake. He got a new body. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Did this new body happen to have jagged prongs and a Cannon phaser on top of its head? No. Phew! He had a huge, gigantic wig on. - Uh-oh. - What? The spikes are under the wig! Oh, no! Of course! Your friends may be in grave danger. He must have sabotaged the factory. Quickly, hoist me up on top of your head. We must depart straightaway. Uh You're stronger than you know. Also, I'm lighter than you know. I'm sorry we didn't find any hangmen. I don't even know what I'd do with a hangman if I got one. Bloo-hoo. Bloo-hoo. Ah, bloo-hoo. Moe! Bandits stole my legs! Yeesh. If you tell us where the bandits went, we'll avenge your legs! We're sorry we left you! You should be. I'm your gwampa wobot. Carry me. Over here. There! There's the thief! The thief with my legs! NEPTR? Throw him out! Come on. Maybe NEPTR did it like, accidentally? NEPTR's out cold. He's got a heck of a dent on his head. What? Who could have done that? Forget him! You love me, right? You love me like BMO? What? You're all right, but we we love BMO. Yeah, man, be cool. BMO's like our best friend. - BMO's trash! - Moe! Moe's dead! AMO? You don't love me! Ow! Aah! Wake up and love me! Imposter! AMO! Hello, BMO. I'm your cute sibling, AMO. I know about you and your dirty hands. Where are Finn and Jake? I think Finn and Jake went somewhere to buy me a gift. Tell me what you did with Finn and Jake and our poop. Ay! Ayyyyy! AMO, look at my face! You gone too far! Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! Bye! You can't escape the birthday boy! Too high. Hey! Talk, AMO! You want to know where papa is? Here is all that remains of him His memory backup drive. Oh. I was returning from a long pilgrimage. I came to confront papa, for I had discovered terrible things about myself. He was dying. "AMO, dear child, my body is conking out." "Take this. It is who I am. Send my mind into space, so I may spend the eons among the stars and other brilliant gasses." His hands were as cold as clay. Our papa never loved me, so I ignored his last request. I used his knowledge of the factory and its MOs to destroy them. Is that you, AMO? They didn't love me, either. Where you been? What are you doing? No! Then I learned about you and your new family. I wanted a taste of that melon. People in my life don't love me. I'll obliterate, y'all! You cheat. Give me those memories. BMO, I don't want to look at you! Tough nuts! For Moe! BMO! Hey. We caught the tail end of what happened. - Are you okay? - No. Well, I don't like that. BMO, will you live with us back at the factory? With Moe gone, you can be our leader. I don't think I can. I'm not grown up Or I'm too grown up now. I think I just killed someone. I need to have some time alone, but you're all really nice. All right. Sorry your birthday was weird. That was the craziest thing that ever happened. But I guess, after all that, I do feel a bit more grown. Except that the mission was just some made-up lie. So who knows if I will ever grow up at all. And Moe is gone now. So if there is anything he wanted to teach me, it better be in me already. I guess all I can do is listen to the heart Moe gave me. Except that's what AMO did, and he turned out bad. So what if I turn out bad, too? AMO could not think outside his programming and was blinded. But your imagination lets you see the world how it could be. But I am different. It's not just Moe up here, it's me, too. And if I cannot trust in Moe, I can trust in me. Oh, boy. It sure is confusing being grown. I miss you, Moe. What a day! I'm gonna miss you, too, BMO. I feel so very, very proud of you.


    These anti-fog goggles work a treat. Yeah, but now they stink of dog breath.  Guess what, though? When we get to the water park, I'm gonna be ready in super-quick time, because look I'm already wearing my swim trunks! I knew there was something different about you today. Oh, wait. Did you remember to pack your usual shorts and underwear for getting changed into after the water park?  Carry on without me. I'll take a shortcut through the toadstool fields and get there before you! Heh, heh. I may have stinky dog breath, but at least I don't have to concern myself with underwear.  At first I had no underwear But this time, I brought underwear I'm glad I remembered my underweaaaar!  Oof! Because I feel creepy without it!  Eee! Well done for remembering your underwear, Finn. It's a long story. You see, I forgot to bring shorts and underwear for after the water park, but then I went home and I got some.  Oh, that's where I'm going. I take swimming lessons at the water park. Where's Jake? He's probably nearly there by now.  Aww, don't cry. He'll be fine on his own till we get there. It's not me. Look!  Princess Orangutan, what's wrong? Well, I'd been playing all morning when I noticed this puddle.  I only wanted to rest and cool my legs down. But when I brought them back out of the water, they were covered in daddy-sad-heads!  Yuck! Can't you just spin your legs around and send them all flying? I can't. I'm too sad. Daddy-sad-heads secrete a tear toxin that makes the host too sad to get rid of them, even though all it would take is a good shake. Don't worry, Princess!  I've got the perfect tool for the job. And I'm already in my swim trunks. No, wait! Don't go in the water! Ooh! Why am I crying? I just told you, it's a tear toxin. Were you not listening? I was half-listening.  Did you hear the part about how they just need a good shake to get rid of? Yeah, but I don't want to shake them. What if I hurt them?  Maybe they'll just have to stay on forever. Ugh! This is miserable. I know. I use visualization techniques with my swimming students all the time. But I already know how to swim. I know, but what if you visualize the daddy-sad-heads as little jingling bells or something? And if you ring them, it'll cheer everybody up. I don't see how a jingling bell would cheer anybody up, but I'll give it a try. Jingle, jingle. Jingle, jingle. Nope, it didn't work. Next plan? Okay, let's do this properly. Shut your eyes and Keep that thing away from me! Okay. When you open your eyes, you're going to be the court jester in the court of king daddy-sad-head, and he's really sad.  So he needs you to do a dance in your funny jingle suit to cheer him up, okay?  Um, okay.  Mm. I think it's working!  That's great, Finn. Keep it up! Come with me, your majesty. Hup! Hey, where are you How do you like your new jingling jester chair? Ooh!  That visualization technique worked a treat! Glad I could be of service. Finn, as a token of my gratitude, please accept this reward. It's a magic coin that can turn into any value of any currency you want. Oh, cool! Will it work in the lockers at the water park? Well, yeah, I suppose so, but Nice one. Chuck it over. Whoops! Oh, wait. Jake's been waiting for ages. What if he gives up on me and goes home? Well, I can give you a lift if you're not afraid of flying. Here I come, Jake! Don't give up on me and go hoooome! Don't worry about me, guys. I'm happy to walk.  What's taking Finn so long? Tell you what, he's got seven Six more minutes, and then I'm just heading in there without him. I mean, I can't be expected to sit here all day waiting for Hey, Jake! Ah, here he comes now. Sorry I'm late. Uh! - I had to go - Thanks again, Finn. - Bye! - No problem. See you later! Yeah, I had to rescue Princess Orangutan there. But guess what? She gave me a reward that's going to come in very handy very soon. Ohhh. Look, I brought us two gold coins so we can have a locker each. No way! Oww! What the heck?! Sorry! I was just trying to stop you putting the coin in before I showed you my magical item. Well, I hope it's a healing item after you just crimped my wrist with a metal door! No, look. It's a magic token that can fit in any slot. Watch.  We've saved ourselves two gold coins on lockers. Well, not really, 'cause the lockers give you the coins back, anyway. Yeah, but this way only one of us has to carry a key. Yeah, but if we lock my locker, then lock my key in your locker, we would only have to carry one key, but we'd still have a whole locker each. Yeah, but could we just use the reward I earned for being so brave and rescuing a Princess, please? Okay, fine. Thanks very much.  Water slide! Water slide! Water slide!  No running on poolside, guys. And we ask that all pool users take a quick shower on the way in. Cheers, guys. Hey, guess what, dude? See that big pile of ginger hair and dirty bubbles clogging the drain? Yeah? Well, that's your favorite snack of all time! Yuck! No way, bro! That's your favorite snack of all time! Yuck! No way! Yes, way! Blech! Yuck!  Ginger hair. That's gross.  Water slide! Water slide! Water sliiiide!  Okay, let's have one more go on the slide, then I am turning this water park into a frozen water park. And if anyone doesn't like it, tough. Hey, Ice King. Hey, Ice King. Oh! Uh ha ha. I didn't recognize you two there in your swimwear.  Listen, guys, you'll get no trouble from me today. I'm just enjoying a relaxing day off, okay? Okay.  Prank, prank, prank! Idea for prank! Details for a prank!  Ahem! Uh-oh! I've just lost my nerve. Excuse me. Comin' through. Ha ha, what a wimp. Good! Now kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick! Can I borrow one of these? Thank you! Can I take one of these? Thank you. Right, off you go. Um, I just need to work up my courage.  What a pair of absolute cowards.  Okay, found my courage. Aqua brakes!  Okay, dude. You inflate yourself, but wait till I'm out of the  Right. Next. Okay, you ready?  Here we goooo! Hey! What just happened?  Could I ask you not to climb back up the slide, sir? Just ride it all the way to the bottom. Thanks. I didn't do anything! One minute I was on my way down, and the next I'm back up here! All right, let's try that one again, shall we? Here we goooo!  Now, hold on a minute.  It's too dark to see, but there must be a A trampoline or something stuck in the tunnel bouncing me back up. Very funny, sir. I think I would've noticed someone bringing a trampoline into the slide. Listen, you've got one more chance to slide down properly, okay? There are other people waiting. What's the big hold up?  What are you laughing at? You're something to do with this! It's them! Where's that dog? He can, like, go stretchy and turn into things. I don't know what you're talking about. Jake's up there sitting in the viewing gallery. Look. And he's reading a pamphlet.  Hmmm Keep your eyes on that dog. Here we go. Oh, come on! Dog didn't move a muscle, sir. Let's see if it works for me. Hey! Here comes Finn!  No running and no queue jumping! Nice work with the pamphlet, by the way.  It was just an extra detail. I'll go get rid of the decoy. Well, that boy didn't seem to have any trouble sliding down. Did you miss us?  I don't now how you did it, but you'd better own up and stop making a fool of me!  Right! That's it! I can't have you assaulting other pool users. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now, sir. Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to freeze now, sir! Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  What? Hey, the water's turned my fingers too pruny to do magic!  Come in. Yeah, there's an old guy lost the plot at the top of the slide. I'm getting the duty manager involved. Fine, get him involved! But I'm not leaving until you carry out a full investigation of this slide and question that pair as prime suspects! Sorry, got to fly! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!  No sliding on the stairs! For goodness sake! Are you about ready to go, Jake? Yeah, just need to fold up my towel. And a lifetime ban means we'll be keeping a picture of you behind reception in case you try to come back. Well, why don't you blow that picture up poster sized, frame it on the wall, and add a touch of class to this dump! Ha ha! That's good one. Oh, if you like that one, you'll love this one! That's your favorite snack of all time! That's your favorite snack of all time! Get him out of here! Thanks, sun! Did you guys have fun at the water park? Yes and no. But mostly yes. Did you teach any kids to swim? As a matter of fact  Are you okay, Finn? Yeah, sorry. This orangutan hair is inside my hood. I need to flush them out in that puddle. No, wait!  That's the same puddle from before!  Look, guys! My new court-jester hat arrived! But it feels a bit too tight. Jingle, jingle! 


Get it, get it! Get him out! Don't you ever let me catch you here again. Did he get you with his poison stingers? No! I got a splinter from the door. Let me see. Wow, that's a tiny splinter. But it hurts! I'm going to need some Fingerprotection! - Thanks, Choose Goose. - I am Choose Goose. Come back for some juice! - Man, I am so protected right now. - That is mighty thick. Go on, hit me! Hey, guys! Check this out! Dude, hit me. On my armor! That is but a thimble! This is real armor. Sir Slicer! Who is the one that bears the thimble? This dude. You foolish boy. Without full body armor, you're weak! You do not look Choose Goose, I need more armor. I've got something for you, a metal shoe! Don't you know you might stub your toe? No Choose Goose, I need Look here your To this one to protect your butt. To his butt! Protect his butt! No Choose Goose, I want Don't be meek. What if you fall down and scrape your cheek? Look at his butt! Look at his butt! Choose Goose, I want the most armor you have! Have a look! - I'll take that one. - Wonderful. I'll need a trade of equal value. I'll take the head of your dog friend. Say what? No way. Choose Goose, this stuff is overpriced. No money for me? How about a poem for free? A poem? If you can decipher the poem and complete the trials, you will receive the magical Armor of Zeldron. It is foretold to be totally Skadow! Your quest begins in the marsh over the hill. - Ah, yes! I'm gonna get that armor! - Yeah, man, you're gonna do it. Good luck exposing your soft, vanilla-strawberry skin to the elements, dork! Later, loosers. He's just jealous that I'm gonna have cooler armor than him. Yeah, what a bumbleberry? What's the poem say? "The sun nibbles on the clouds, and gum drop tears rain down" I don't get it. It means that we have to cross that swamp. How'd you understand that? You don't just read the poetry to understand it. You got to feel it. Trust me, dude, I'm smarter than everyone. - Now get in there! - You're not coming? No way, man. This armor thing is your deal. I'll wait for you on the other side. This place will be a piece of Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry! My most private parts peeped by a boy! - Pervert! - I'm not a pervert! You should be ashamed of yourself! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - My privates! - I'm sorry! - My privates! - I'm sorry! - You okay, man? - No! What's the matter, crimson cheeks? Feeling a little embarrassed in the swamp of embarrassment? You're so red, you look like a tomato. We'll see who's embarrassed when I get that armor! What does the poem say? "The meadow weeps as morning sings of milk and honey and things to come" What does that even? It means we have to silence, the echoing in the woods. Oh, man! I don't know how to silence that! All right, I'll handle this one, dude. No. This is my burden. Then just make her think it's her idea. That's how you make the ladies do what you want. Hey, monster lady! Stop crying! Stop crying because that's what you want to do! She thinks you're her red-faced baby or something. - I think she wants you to nurse, dude. - No! Minstrel. He's Finn the blushing baby His cheeks are bright and red Be sure to make fun of him before you go to bed Grandfathers will sing that to their grandchildren for generations to come. Grandfathers will not sing that to their children! Armor Just wait till I have the Armor of Zeldron! Yeah, just you wait, weirdo. Jake, you okay? Awesome! Finally. Hello. Begone, ghost! I'm here for the armor! First, you have to beat my high score in a game of drop ball. Drop ball? Drop ball is an extremely addictive, high-intensity game designed for people everywhere. Here, let me show you. One point. Two points. - Three points. - This game looks awful. Oh, no. I absolutely disagree. Dude, let's just kill him and get the armor. How? He's already dead. Here. It's your turn. Now, I don't want you to be intimidated, but my high score is six. Just just toss it on the ground. No, no, no! You're doing it all wrong! Let me show you how the pros do it. See? It's all in the technique. Now, I'm gonna put a little finesse into it, just to shake things up. Finn, it's so beautiful! Yeah, guess all the embarrassment was worth it. Greetings, young traveler. We know what you seek, and you shall receive it. Behold the Armor of Zeldron. It will protect you from evil, even ghosts. No! Dude, this is lady armor! No, not No more embarrassment! I don't need armor! You did not watch my drop-ball technique! I give you firsthand tips that no one else knows, and this is how you thank me! I absolutely disagree with that! - Now what? - Put on the armor. It'll protect you from evil, even ghosts! Never! Mama? Yeah! Listen when your mother is speaking to you. Yes, mama. You should be ashamed of yourself, a boy your age sitting in this cave alone for thousands of years. You need to go outside and get some sunlight. But No back talk! Outside now! Oh, thank you, Finn and Jake! You've freed me from the addiction of drop ball. No problem, dude. I couldn't have done it without the power of embarrassment! And I learned I don't need armor to be Look at you losers. Finn, you don't have any armor, and your friend is dressed like a lady. So not Well, at least I don't spend my day following a kid around! Get a life, dude! Good one, Finn. Well, I just been in the same areas today. - Yeah, right. - Whatever. Be quiet! I I am more than all of you. Come over here and say that to my fist! Okay, I will. This armor's too heavy! No problem. I'll just prop myself up on this stick. Splinter! Hey, Sir Slicer, maybe you can use this! Here you go! Free of charge. Come on, dude, let's get out of here. Okay, buddy. Dude, this armor is totally


  All right! Where is he?! Ice King?! Where is he?! Jake? He's right there. Man, Ice King, you better roll on. Where are you hiding him?! Who are you talking about? It's Gunter! He's gone missing! You in there, Goontz? Ice King, we didn't take Gunter. Come on, man, not the food. Daddy's here to save you, Goonty! What makes you think we took him? 'Cause it's obvious You took Gunter, because Gunter is like your Jake. Wait, what? Or maybe Gunter's like your Finn. The point is, you guys have always resented us for that fact, and that right there constitutes motive And conspiracy to harm my little road dog, Gunter! Hey, Jake, do you think you could, like, turn into a little Gunter and go over to him? That's gonna be kind of weird. Yeah, but it'll calm him down, so All right, all right, all right. Wenk, wenk. Aww, look at the little guy. You want to try telling us what happened? Okay, so, we were watching some young men's junior figure skating championships on the tube semi-finals. I went to the kitchen to fix us up something to eat. When I came back, he was gone. What do you think, Jake? Should we check out the ice kingdom for clues? Or we could get a real good night's sleep and start fresh and early in the morning. Wenk, wenk. - Gunter! - Gunter! - Hey, Gunter! - Gunter?! See? He's gone. You're sure you've checked everywhere? He's not behind the fridge. He's not hanging with his boys. - Wenk, wenk. - Wenk, wenk. He's not anywhere near that ransom note. Did you just say "ransom note"?! Yeah, what? You guys act like you ain't never heard of no ransom note before. "If you ever want to see Gunter again, go to Moose Bone Clearing in the forgotten forest. Come alone. Don't bring any cops." No, we better go do what he says! I'm coming for you, Gunter! You know, this could all just be some kind of a goof. He seems for real. - Yo, Ice King, wait up! - Yo, Ice King, wait up! Hey, man, we're coming with you. But they said no cops. We're not cops. Yeah, we are! And this cop is your best chance at finding Gunter! There's Moose Bone Clearing! I wonder if it's called that because it's shaped like a moose bone. Okay, we're right behind you. Put the crown on the ground and leave. Cops what cops? I-i didn't mention any cops. Wait, I mean First, show me Gunter. No. Okay. Poor Gunter. I hope he's okay. This is the day I found him. And this is his first birthday. His 15th birthday. His 115th birthday. The last time I saw Gunter, I was yelling at him for pooting. But it wasn't Gunter who pooted. It was me! Hey, man, you can't blame yourself. Everybody poots. Get him! Hey! Foxes? Hand it over! Wh-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-at?! Jake! Whoa, dude! You take those eight, and I'll take that one. Okay, Jakesies fox hunt. Gotcha! It's a tinfoil fake! Whoa! Don't worry, guys! The cavalry's here! This isn't working as well as I thought it would! Give that back! These foxes think they can outfox Ice King. Time to pay a visit to a foxy old friend. Boy, I can't believe how soft and warm and perfectly molded to my body this bed is. I think I'm just gonna see how long I can stay here. All right! Who's there?! All right, up, up! Out of bed! I-Ice King? You guys took one of mine. Now I'm taking one of yours. Tip for tap! Geez Louise, can't you see I'm all tucked in? I bet it's pretty nice and cozy in there. Well, let's see how nice and cozy it is with only one pillow! Not the pillow Aw, man! I had nothing to do with it, okay? What do you know?! Easy on the sheets, man, come on! All I know is somebody was rounding up foxes for some kind of job. But I wanted no part of it honest. Give me a name! Look, I never saw a face, okay? All I saw was a tin can on a string Just your run-of-the-mill, garden-variety tin can on a string! Wenk! Ha-ha! Foiled again? Get it? "Foiled"? How long you gonna stay like that? I don't know. It's pretty nice back support. Hey, guys! I just got valuable intel! What happened to your face, man?! What? You mean this? That's just something that happens when I'm, like, miles and miles away from the crown. You actually look kind of good like that. Nice, full beard, little button nose You look tight! Thanks, dudes. So I found out that our perp has been using some kind of tin can to communicate. Tin can hey, I think I saw one over there. Hah! I found it! Gunter?! I love you, Gunter! Daddy's coming for you! Hello? Agh! Wait Maybe if we follow the string, it'll lead us to the kidnappers. Yeah. Good call! Hurry! Get in! Shotty! I hope they've been feeding him right. If he doesn't like his food, he'll just spit it right back at you. Finn still does that. Man, the only reason I spit those meatballs up is because they were, like, hecka-old. Yeah, my bad. Ooh! Gunter! Aw, he's starting to get gross on my cushions. That's nasty. Wait a minute! Yoink! Whoa! Sorry. You're sorry?! That's all you've got to say?! I was only trying to help. Ice King, hold up! - You see that? - You mean his shnoz? I think it does that when it's pointing at the crown Like a big old nose compass. Hot. Hot. Hot! Cold. Hot. Hotter! Scorchin'! Look! The rest of the string leads into that cave! Lava! I can't cross that. I'll get hot feet! I'll stretch us across. It'll be a cakewalk. No! - I have to save him. - What? Being rescued is an important bonding experience. It has to be me. Finn! Listen, Simon, as a fellow animal lover, I respect your passion. We'll hang back. But what about Gunter? He'll give up in a hot second. Then, we jump in and help. Finn, you're so smart. Okay, Gunter, here I come! Lava-freeze! Ice King, no! Ice King, no! - Nice! - Yes! That's far enough. You got my crown But you didn't give me my Gunter. Now I've got hot feet, but no Gunter! I would give a million, billion, gazillion crowns and every hot feet in the world for just one Gunter! You! You're buh-buh-buh Beautiful! Wenk, wenk. Gunter! Isn't she beautiful? Look, if you want him, you can have him For a hug! All right, close your eyes. Boy. Wenk, wenk. Hey, look, she left me a prezzie. Feels kind of different. Okay, let's go home, Goontz. That's pretty cool.

What? What? What? BOTH: Beemo, get the camera! Beemo is camera. Enough! Now Bow down to me, Cute King, and my legion of cuties!  Great shot, Beemo! Since you won't take us seriously, we will kill you! Until then, enjoy your burrito, Jake. Huh? My burrito! It's perfectly fine! No, Finn. They probably poisoned it! Naaaw. They knew my name. They knew about the burrito. Man, you're letting your brain dial turn your fear volume up. You'll see. Those cuties are nothin' but an afternoon's delight.  Jake? What are you doing in my bed? Oh, nothin' much, you know, just chillin'. Wait a second. Are you still messed up about those little guys? A little. Look, man, what do you say tomorrow morning we go track those little guys down and find out just what their deal is? Sound good, buddy? Yeah. Thanks, buddy. Man, you sound just like mom sometimes. Yeah. Good old mom. She always knew just what to say. Yeah. Good night, brotha. Good night. JAKE: Finn! Finn! Finn, wake up, man! Wha?! Huh? I think someone's in the house.  For real, man! Shh. Listen. Uh I swear, man. I really heard something. Finn! I heard. Okay. Who's out there? What the?! That's my sword! What do they want with my sword, man?  It came from downstairs! All right. That's it. Where are you going? I'm gonna go manhandle those guys' banandles. What? FINN: Well, they broke a window, but I don't see any of 'em. I guess they left. Oh, no! Oh, oh, no! Jake, what is it? Oh, no! It's a dead goat, man! Its guts are all over the place! It's all chopped up and spread around and -- Oh, no, wait. It's just a blanket. I think I left it here this morning.  Jake! Finn! This is the voice of your mom! I've come back to tell you how dumb you always are! I hate you guys so much! Oh! Get him, Jake! Aah! Aah!  Blauwgh! Jake, I got him! He's freakin' out, man! - What do I do?! - Shake him! What?! Shake him around till he stops! Okay- They stopped. Okay- Now tell 'em not to talk about our mom. How do you even know about our mom? We've been watching you. Learning your weaknesses. What?! Why?! For tomorrow morning. When our army comes and kills you both. You think we're so cute, when actually we're the opposite of that!  Waah! Hold him!   Oh, gross! Well? Do you believe me now, Finn? I I don't know what to believe anymore. Well, that's close enough. Let's start settin' up some barricades. There's got to be a thousand of em! Wait. Jake, look! JAKE: These guys aren't a threat to anyone. These guys are a threat to themselves.  Ow!  Oh, hey, it's what's his face. No! My men! Quickly, men! Pick yourselves up before the enemy sees! Come on, now. That's it. Easy does it. Ow. Bravest warriors, I ask you, must we have our butts handed to us by everyone we meet?! How will we ever splash around in the brains of our enemies if you guys can't take two steps without exploding?! Bliblob, I'm lookin' at you!  Can I please just get one victory once?!  Now, don't start that! Don't you do it! You want to just smash 'em all? What?! No, man, look, these guys aren't gonna quit until they win or die. And they're not gonna win. So what if we let 'em win? Just this once? What?! And mess up my stats?! No, we'd be winning by helping them to win. That's a win. And then they'll be happy and leave us alone. All right. Yesss! Now let's rally an army so we can look intimidating! Who are we gonna call? All of our friends. My army of friends, today we will lose this battle. But we will also win it!  When the enemy charges, crumble like a cookie. When you feel their puny punches, fade like a flower and writhe in your own blood! But -- but -- how are we to bleed if none of this is real? With faith, Milady. And ketchup.  Ketchup is delicious and deceiving! And, hey, guys, let's keep the acting subtle. Less is more! No way. First, I'm gonna fall in love with one of those little guys. And then I'm gonna fall out of love. And then I'm gonna totally fake die of a fake heart attack! Oh! My heart! My heart hurts because I fell out of love! And now I have to die! Ohhhhhhh! Get ready, y'all. Together, we fall! Unh! Not yet, Cinnamon Bun! Yaah! ALL: Whoa! Oh, no! My bloooood! Whooooa!  Hey! One last kiss before dying, my love.  Farewell forever! Oh! Oh, my heart! Aah! I'm dead! Victory is ours!  Finally I can do the victory dance!  La Lada La da da la La da da da da La la la la-la la Oh, I'm sorry, everybody! I couldn't keep it in! CUTE KING: No! This is ketchup?! It tastes better than blood. Or does it? Hey, Finn, you think blood tastes better than ketchup'? Jake, look.  Aw, nuts. Cute King, wait up! We want to apologize for being fakers. We did it to protect you from yourselves. It doesn't matter now. No one will ever fear our strength. But strength isn't your strength. Adorable cuteness is! Can I use it to control others? Um Yeah, sure! Just be righteous about it. Show me where to start.  Pbht pbht pbht Pbht pbht pbht pbht Pbht pbht pbht pbht pbht pbht pbht Huh? Who could that be? I command you to make me a sandwich! What?! No one commands the Ice King to make no sandwich! What about now? Okay!    


    Jake! Jake! Hey, man, shouldn't we conserve our energy? The Ice Creamarathon starts tomorrow. I know what the Ice Creamarathon is. I've been training for weeks, and I am determined to eat more ice cream at the Ice Creamarathon than anyone else! You sure like ice cream. Ice cream is good.  What the croak was that? Came from over there.  Whoa, Jake! Check it out!  It's a brave, little gnome knight. What? That's frog dressed up like a gnome knight. Actually, I'm a gnome knight who was magically transformed into a frog, and then I decided to continue being a knight. And now you're, like, attracting a mate? No! I'm on the verge of death. Oh. Well, you should just let go, man. Yeah. You've had a good run. No. I cannot die until I find a being whose spirit is brave and pure to take over my quest. Quest? Uh-oh. Somebody's gonna do a quest for a frog. Tell me more about thisquest. I have to guard these magic beans! Huh? Two of the beans are good, but one is horribly evil! I have no idea which is which, so I've spent my life guarding them, preventing them from ever being planted. Beans?  Magic beans. We'll be right back. Come on, Finn. I think I dropped my spoon in the bush. We will take your quest. You will? Sure! Consider it guarded. Also, take this. Oh. Uh, okay. Thanks. No. Thank you. Uh Whoa! - Dude, what's going on? We took over the quest. What?! The beans?! Now, wait a second. Nope. Too late.  I miss him already. Well, we should get a move on if we want to make the Ice Creamarathon. What about the quest? Really? We have to do the bean quest? I gave him my word. Yeah, I wasn't here for that, so can't we guard the beans and eat ice cream? No, man. We're on the job. And like you always say, "work and fun don't mix" "Unless you're a clown." I do say that a lot. Gee. Sitting in this hot sun, guarding beans. Boy, it sure beats 26 miles of vanilla ice cream, or caramel ice cream, or peach ice cream. Hey, what if we plant the beans ourselves? - That's a terrible idea. - No, wait. Hear me out. See, if one of these beans is evil, then it's our duty to crush it once and for all. Plus, two of the beans are good. If we plant them, we'll be bringing twice as much good into the world. And we can make it to the Ice Creamarathon. I hadn't even thought about that!  So they planted the beans and waited for evil to gro-o-o-w So they could kill it and g-o-o-o to the Ice Creamarathon I'm gonna take a catnap. What?! But we have to be ready for evil. If we take shifts, there's less chance of us falling asleep at the same time. All right, Finn, Jake's a lazy bum, and this soil is ripe with evil. I cannot go to sleep until that evil bean sprouts and is destroyed.  Wake up, Jake! This is it! Huh? Aah! Bean pod! Hmm. I can't tell if it's evil yet!  Aah! Yea-a-a-a-a-a-a-h!  Huh? Baby pigs dressed in silly costumes? Aw, look how cute they look, all sleepy and snorey. Careful, Jake. It could be a trap. We should test them to see if they're evil.  Okay, each one of you take one test and one pencil. You have one hour to complete the test and prove we shouldn't kill you. And begin.  Aw, they're so cute, They can hardly hold their pencils. That doesn't fare well for their grade-point average. Nothing evil could be this adorable. PIG: Wee-wee! Hmm, You might be right. The only thing on here is a cute drawing of an ice cream cone under "do you have allerjies?" Yeah, nothing evil. Okay. The pigs are good. Yes! You hear that, guys?! You passed! A-plus! A-plus-plus! Oh, no! Jake, get ready! The second pod is about to drop! Protect the piglets! Stay back, babies! Show me what you have to offer, pod.  Magical wands? Wha?! Cool! Stop, Jake! - Wow! - Is it evil? It's a wand that poops glitter. What's good-er than that? Whee-hee-hee-hee-hee! Hmm. Glitter on its own could be evil, but with rainbows? Over my dead body. Hey, let's have some fun with these pigs before the evil pod shows up. Yeah! Whew! I'm exhausted. They look so sleepy and peaceful. We have to stay alert. The evil pod could appear at any time. When it does, we must be ready to destroy it immediately. And then go to the Ice Creamarathon, right? Yeah, man.  Okay. I'll take the first shift. Rhombus.  Aah! Look! The third pod! It's bigger than the other two, dude. Yeah, man. We got to kill itnow. Yea-a-a-a-a-h! Unh! Yeah! Yeah!  Huh? It's squirting. Squirting? He-yup! See? Squirting. Right here.  Tastes good. Dang, man. Don't just lick stuff. It's evil. - No, it's not. It'sice cream!  Is the evil sucking you in?! Jake! That was awesome. Are you poisoned?! Are you dying? No, man! It was awesome! Look, Jake. It's filling back up. Aw, yeah! This pod makes ice cream out of nothing! It's the goodest thing that's ever happened to me. Well, if this pod's not evil The piglets are gone! And so are the fairy wands.  Let's go! The screaming sounds are getting stronger near Mushroom Town!  Piglets! Stop this! Aah!  Cram! Now I must find these wicked piglets' weakness and use it to retro-buse them. Well, I've found my weakness. That's it! Ice cream! What about ice cream? Yes. Yes. Ha! The exams confirm my memory of the piglets being allergic to ice cream. Just the thought of that scares me, man. I see one of them! Get ready to release! Release!  JAKE: Oh, gross. FINN: Gross, man! Jake! Ugh. Jake. Jake, are you okay? I-I-I can't stop dancing! What?! It must be the glitter! Whoa. I really can't stop groovin'. It feels weird! Go on without me!  Yea-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-h!  Freezed to meet you! Hope you saved room for dessert!  Killing you with ice cream!  Whoo! Yeah, man! Whoa!  Jake, there's one left, and I think he's trying to surrender. Kill it! But he's dressed as a little construction worker. It's freakin' adorable. He's trying to trick you! Kill it! I just don't know if I can bring myself to do it, Jake.    Why, thank you, Finn and Jake, for sort of saving our village. You're sort of welcome. Now, if you'll excuse us, we need to start removing all of this ice cream from our homes and businesses. JAKE: Not so fast. I'll take it from here, folks.  He likes ice cream.  Nice job, Tubby, but save room for the Ice Creamarathon. I've always got room for ice cream, Finn. You know that, man. Ugh. I'm going to the Ice Creamarathon. He just really likes ice cream. Oh!    This party is so crazy!


  Nice. Little bird family on vacay. Daddy's got the mad-beautiful tail feathers. Mommy's taking up the rear all plain-Jane styles. Glad I get to date a beautiful Rainicorn not some nasty bird. Hey! Don't be talking trash! Our ladies are beautiful on the inside, you creep! All lady birds around the whole world are beautiful on the inside? - Yes. - Fair enough. Special delivery for Jake the Dog. Cool. Thanks. Hmm. "Urgent." Hold still, BMO! Ouch! I hurt my butt sledding. Oh, dang. Sorry, BMO. Cool, man! I'm excited! What the heck am I looking at? Jake Jr?! What's going on here?! Jake the Dog, we have your daughter. She is safe for now. What do you want from me?! We need you to reassemble your old team Gareth, A.K.A. The Lady Master The Flying Lettuce Brothers, notorious conmen impressionists and your old friend Tiffany. Globbit. You will need them to break into the royal candy vault and steal this. The baker's shard the purest source of sugar in the known regions. You are the only master thief with the skills to swipe it. You have until midnight to make the drop. Tell anyone, and Jake Jr. Gets it. BMO destroy the tape. Are we on the level, BMO? I ain't no clown-town snitch, baby. I don't want Finn hearing about this. All right. Oh, Brunard, are you sure? Yeah, babe. I'm totally famous, and you love me. W-What's happening? What am I feeling now? You are under the spell of my face. I got you, girl, in my face trap, and you love it. I do. Brunard, don't ever leave me. I'll give you everything my fabrics, my dress patterns, my marbles, my social standing. Whoops! I gotta go. Laters! Dine and dash? I saw that! - Hey, boss, I wanted to - Shut up, Tonya. I gotta see my ex-wife! Ohh. Hello. Squeezy Mart. Tonya, this is your boss! Wait. You were just here. Yeah! Now I'm on the phone, stupid! Hey, do you think I could leave early? I'm, like, depressed. What you could do is take all the money out of the register and give it to the two guys out back by the dumpster! Okay. Then can I go? - Yes. Here you go, dudes. Thanks, man. - Peace. - Goodbye, fair lad. The master returns! Well, well. From the shadows of dream, the dog wakes to find its uh the dog wakes to find its mangy tail flopping in the dust like a fish in a tree. That fish is me Tiffany! I'm coming, Jake! I'm coming! Hi, guys. Were you waiting for me in the dark? Tiffany wouldn't let us turn them on. Never mind that! The real question is what's that slo-mo Finn know about this? Hey, BMO, where's Jake? Jake got back with his old gang and is going to rob the Candy Kingdom. Okay, BMO. You want to join my primitive noise band? Huhhhh? No. I like organized sound. Pshh!  La-la-la! Whoo! Nah, BMO's covering for me. So, what's the deal, Jake? Yeah, why'd you call us back? I got a job for you guys. One last score the big one. The baker's shard? Are you for real, man? Hey, that's crazy, Jake. We always said, "play it safe." Can't you see, guys? He's desperate. Somebody got to him 'cause he's soft now. What the pshh! Tiffany! I'm the same Jake! I just stopped stealing, mostly. Because when you get older, you're supposed to get into other stuff, like graphic design or pottery. It's called "growing up"! I don't wanna do poetry I mean, pottery. Dude! Are you guys on board or what?! You really got something better to do?! Really?! I know you don't, Tiffany! Glom you, Jake. How are we gonna split the baker's shard? We ain't keeping it. I'm passing the shard off to a mystery dude. What the?! The dude has my kid. My little Jake Jr. I'm in. We're in. I know that vault inside and out every guard rotation, every camera, every deadly trap. And that safe is locked up so tight, it makes me wanna spit out my guts and cry about it. Do you even have a plan, Jake?! I have the first part. Okay, let's freakin' do this! Captain, the milk delivery has arrived. Well, check them in, Private. Yes, sir. And, Private, I'm very thirsty. Bring me back the most delicious flavor they have. Yes, sir! Huh? Now, what in the heck? I'm back with your milk, sir. What flavor did you bring me, private? Banana, sir! - What?! - Banana milk! Blagh! No! The forbidden flavor! It's delicious. It's it's it's It's delicious! Attention, all guards! You are directed to report immediately to the courtyard for special training! Okay, do your thing, man. Just like old times, right, Jake? When we were blood, we'd follow each other into the jaws of death on a pale horse. Not now, Tiffany. Come on! Ugh! Today, we'll be working on our battle "keeyahs." Okay, men! Sound off! All right, soldiers, time to shred those pipes! I wanna hear you scream! Louder! Push it hard! The baker's shard is on the other side of that the corridor of a thousand deaths. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Yow! Wow! Whoa! Whew! I did it! For Jake Jr.! Stop right there. You! Where's my daughter?! Throw me the bakers shard, and I'll let her go. Yeah, right! That's super-dumb! Daddy! Please do what he says! Hang on, sweetie! Ungh! Thank you for saving me Daddy! You dirty Now uh I'm the dog, and you're the tail! Now you chase me! You chase my dreams! Alert. Security breach. Alert. Jake Jr.! Oh, crud! Jake! I love you! I love yo-o-o-o-u! Shut it, Tiffany! Give me my daughter! Ta-da! I totally double-crossed you! Jake Jr?! What the puke, girl?! Let's get out of here! What the funky fresh, honey? I just wanted to be like you. Mom told me stories about when you did crimes. That was a long time ago before I knew it was wrong! I thought you'd be proud of me. I am. I couldn't have done that when I was your age. I age fast, remember? I'm 22! Right. I keep forgetting maths. What are you gonna do about the old crew? Finn and I will bust their apples tomorrow. Or maybe the banana guards will get 'em. Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Come on. I'll take you home now. - I love you, pops. - I love you, too. Don't stinkin' do this to me again. I'm old and fat. I'll probably have a heart attack. Okay. Wait a minute! You're doing a long con right now, aren't you? No. Yes. Now I'm really proud of you!  


  There goes, there goes! You peep it, bro? Yonder goes! Glob's helmet coming in fast! Yo, I'm zoomed in too far. Making me sick. See it? Sees it! Whoa, good thing it sprinkled this morning, right? This tall, wet grass feels good on my legs. Huh, what? Who's that? I don't know. It looks like we should've skipped brunch. Early bird got the worm, and then the worm was his brunch. Our brunch was sick. Right. Now we got the calorie fuel to jump this fool. Oh, my truth, dude! - Is that Betty? - Betty's dead. Disappeared doesn't always mean dead. Eh, you're right. She looks alive. Alive and off the grid, snatching up Glob remnants. I got a weird feeling in my fat basket. Like, what does she want with Glob's helmet, and why has she got new glasses on? What do we want with Glob's helmet? Dude, we're scavengers. Is that what we are? Okay, stealth mode. Oh, no, man! Magic man's house! Likely, he's got Betty under a mind-control spell! Shoot, man, I don't want to deal with this guy. He's a tough adversary, but if we hide in the trees, pinpoint his location, maybe you can sever his spine before he can do his magic on us. Good plan! Get the spine! Whoa! Whoa! Babies! Ohh! There goes! Shh, shh! Peace. Like a red, raw trash hatch. You're in luck! Come on! You get to rule over my house while I'm gone for the rest of forever right here on my shelf of special friends, Margles and tiny manticore. You promised me I would rule! How can a coward rule the roost? You escaped once and came right back. How sad is that, huh? You gave me some kind of hostage syndrome! I need therapy! Well, Finn and Jake are heroes, so try being more like them, why don't you? Peace! Finn and Jake?! What did you do?! You monster! I would do something if I could! You hear me, magic man?! You hear me?! What's all that yelling? Little guy's sad to see me go. Well, there it is what remains of your brother, Glob.  What remains? Tell me what remains Some loser smashed out your brains  End of song. So, this thing's really gonna transmute you into the new Glob? Of course, and then I'm gonna make it rain on Mars in a bad way. Fire up those ovens, honey! This is exciting! A little sad though, right? Which part? Your brother blowing up in space. Doesn't that mess you up? Nothing messes me up. I don't believe that. Like, who is Margles, and why is there a picture of her on your shelf? Something there connects to who you are and your magic. Someone shines a light into my dark-wizard matter, a way to unclose the circuit of magic Madness And sadness. That's right. M.M.S. runs through all magic users. I hung out with scores of them, all displaying varying degrees of magic Madness And sadness. Studying these symptoms could lead me to their underlying cause, and then I'll control the forces that hold sway over Simon. - I see. - You see what? The coconut crab who swims in your neighbor's pool at night. Maybe Simon's in there, too. Who else holds their breath in there, Betty? All magic users swim in the loomy gloom. Finn and Jake, if you can hear me, listen! There's a lady downstairs. She thinks she can save her B. F., Simon, by finding the source of magic, but she ain't gonna find Jack squat! Magic man's using her! He's gonna make her a talking skateboard or something stupid like that. I can't help because I'm psychologically powerless! But you are heroes, and I believe in you! I believe! You hear me?! Please! Go Jake or Finn! Which ever! Save her! Wait! No! Oh, Glob, I'm sorry! I didn't plan this out! Whew! Good pump! Fire's ablaze! Pump to failure that's what weightlifters say. So, what happens now? We sweat it out in a magic-induced trance. My essence marinates Glob's helmet with its ancient human DNA code, which should cause it to act as a sorcerer's stone for your transmutation into the Globhead. Which should allow me to activate my ancient martian transport. Is this gonna change you? Will it change you? And will you be hungry after? Why don't you finish baking your famous bread, huh? This is your last chance! The dirt should break your fall, then it's up to you 'cause I'm useless. Go! Yes! Do it! Bread's going In. Hurry up, Betty. All the answers to your theories as our spirits meld. Okay, be right there! It's gonna get sweaty? The more skin mist, the better. So, you're not afraid of what I might see in you? No, dumb-dumb. You imagined the lock before the key. You think this is the key, but it's a waste basket. Flumes open! We'll see. Smooth and gray as far as you can see. No life grows in me. Nothing to weed. Nothing to seed. Pure and perfect. Like the marble floors of a bank. You slide with no obstacles, forever blank. Whoa. It really is like he said. Sort of cool, though. The key. Whoa. Aha! Bingo! Whoa! Margles? Open your eyes, Margles. Who's that? I'm magic man, and that's my sibling, Glob. Hi. Uh, could I talk to you a sec? Okay. What's up? That's our new planetary defense system? Yeah, Margles. Margles is your wife, dude. My wife was taken by Golb. This is like my tribute. I'm gonna install her right there on Olympus mons so she can protect us from Golb. But you named her after your wife. Yeah, but it stands for "Magical Automated Resistance Generating Laser Energy Supplier." - Come again? - Whatever. I wanted to call her Margles. So, you used magic to make her, and you don't think your feelings for your lost wife might have compromised your spell programming? No, that's crazy. Her appearance is just a symbol of Margles. Why do I feel like this is the worst idea ever? What a great idea going on this hike. Why didn't you magic us up? Uh, I guess I wanted to know more about you since I created you in a deep trance state. All I am is in you, so know yourself, magic man. Yeah, duh. Okay. To the top then! Whoa! Zaa! Okay, then, ready to initiate the install? - Yes. - Wait, hold on. You should come back down. I got to stop the second coming of Golb. Uh, he's probably not coming back. I wish he would. Maybe I would see you again Original you. I looked everywhere, you know. So what? Every dimension, every dead world. I even wished you back in Prismo's time room. Balls, man, that has never happened before. But you were gone, erased, only existing here And here. For hundreds of years, I held that sadness, until my magic and science were strong enough to create you from my nightmares. Then let me do what you built me for. I take it back! Aah! Don't activate, Margles! You came from me, so you got to understand! I came from Your nightmares! Unh! Ohh! Unh! Oomph! Wait, what's happening?! Aah! What the Oh, look, the bread's alive. Betty, you see?! I see a crab emerging from a dark pool. Oh, yeah? What does the crab say? Aaaaah! Laters! Whoa. My sadness is gone, and my Ow! Hey! Murm, muph, maph. Do what? Murm, muph, maph. Turn you back? Meph! I can't. I think I'm just a normie now. Maybe someone in wizard city can help. Ow! Maph, moh. Ow! Finn, is that you and Jake? My, muh, mu, mimuh, mimuh. Fly you to wizard city? I can't! Meh, moo, mam! Moo, mah, mu, uh! Thank you, heroes! You helped me find my courage! Mih, muh, mim, mo, muh. What do normies do? Get smoothies or something?


    Hmm? Oh, hello there.  Baybel Navel, it's great to see you! Here for more graybles, I reckon. Well, all right. Just like last time, we'll watch five separate stories, each relating to one special theme. Guess the theme by the end of the episode and you'll be the freshest mint-whistle.  Now, look to my visualizer screen and let this exciting grayble dribble all over your mind-label.  Okay, so  Scooch. Okay, so I'm still pretty sure this old book's some warlock's spell book or something.  FINN: Messed! Warlocks, dude. You ready for some ancient feel-good spellcraft? Yeah, I'll try it. Could always stand to feel better. Let's see you got your bibby? Check it.  Yep. Little Jack Horner sat in the corner, eating a Christmas pie. He put in his thumb and pulled out a plum and said, "what a good boy am I."  I don't feel like a good boy. You sure you read the spell right? Mmm. Yeah.  Still, though pretty sweet. Wanna keep sticking our thumbs in stuff until it works? Yeah!  Oh, what a good boy am I! Oh, what a good boy am I. Oh what a good boy am I. Oh, what a good boy am I! Oh, what a good boy am I. Oh, what a good boy am I.  Oh, what a good boy am I. Oh, what a good boy  Do you feel like a good boy? No, I don't. Hey, check out that gross toad!  BOTH: Oh, what a good boy am I. Gross. Cut it out. Quit sticking your thumbs in my back. Yeah, I don't know.  Geez, I'm never going to find this place! Hmm  Hey!  Hey! Hey, Rock Giant.  You seem cool! Do you know where Wizard Bill's music shop is? I can't find it anywhere. He's got a guitar that plays the most savory licks in Ooo.   Huh.  Huh. I've got an idea. Okay, point now! Aah!  Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Thanks, man!   Hey, let's find some more holes.  La-da-da, la-da-da   BOTH: Oh, what a good boy am I!  Boys, your manners. Oh! Oops! Oh,  SHELB Y: Hey, Tree Trunks. Excuse me sir, I wasn't looking where I was - Tree Trunks, up here! - Oh, no! Heavens no! MAN: I'm glad you brought this matter to the authorities, ma'am. Now what exactly happened? Yes, thank you. I-I heard a man calling out to me "Oh, Tree Trunks." So I said "Who's calling? I don't know." So I looked, and he was making a rude gesture. It left a sour taste in my mouth. All right, ma'am. Let's see. How do you spell your name? - T - Okay. R - Okay. E - Okay. E - One sec. E. - Hold on one second. Ugh, I'm sorry, but the wheels of justice spin too slowly. I'm going to have to take the law into my own hands. Thank you all for coming. The police have failed me in my time of need, so I have brought you here together. A posse. I made you all blackjacks in case things get ugly. I stuffed some of my stockings with balled-up newspapers. I made a big one for you because you're so strong. All right, then. Let's clean up these streets! Ohh! There he is! Goodness! BOTH: Eeeeee!  Oh! Why it's just a statue. I-I don't understand. It was so rude before. SHELB Y: Hey, Tree Trunks! Oh! Hey, Tree Trunks, how are you? Shelby, have you been up there all day? Yes. Just reading this book! Oh, well, can you read somewhere else? You kind of offended Tree Trunks here. What? Uh uh Oh. Oh!  I get it. Wonderful! Family meeting! Family meeting, gather 'round. Things are gonna change around here very soon. You're gonna have a new mommy to help boss you around. I mean, well, I haven't exactly asked her yet. Well, no time like the present.  Sweetie, are you awake? Great, 'cause I've got a query I've been meaning to inquire of you. Well uh  Oh, well when two people will will you marry me? Oh, yay.  Yes, yes, drink up the tears. Drink up those good luck tears. No, not you Gunther. You're on a low salt diet. Huh? What's that dear? Oh, I almost forgot.  Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo  It's a wife ring. This one's for me. I'm the husband. That means I get the remote control three days a week, and you get it four.  Ahh, sweetie, this is bliss. Feels so math to finally be normal, not like those two freaks. What are they doing over there? Anyway, I Ooh, who's that? Oh. Oh, my. BMO: Poor Football, you've come so far and still have so much to learn. But I don't understand, BMO. I'm a real baby girl now. I can smell raddest lilacs. I'm can hear the screaming squirrels, screaming for nuts. Oh, my gosh. I can't believe it's true. No, Football. That's not enough. You have to learn manners, too. Otherwise, you'll be all alone. Alone? But but what about you, BMO? I will not always be here to protect you, Football. No, you must learn. Here, look. This is a grapefruit spoon. It's only for eating grapefruits. This is a salt shaker. Here, you try.  Now, this a turnip grincher For grinching. And this is how you drink tea. Ahh! Like this?  Yuck. It's bitter. No, no. Football, like this.  Like this?  No, like this.  Like this?  Like this!  Like this, right?  No, Football. Do it like huh? Pbht! Sorry, Football. Lesson's over for tonight. FINN: Why so glum, fellas? We stuck our thumbs in almost every hole today. But we never felt like good boys.  I know a thing or two about good boys. Why don't you try sticking your thumbs in these holes? Controllers? BOTH: Oh, yeah! "Super Good Boys." So, did you guess the theme? Go ahead and pause your viewer now if you need a few more glaybels to think about it a little. Oh, oh.  Now you've got it. I can tell. That's right. The theme is "The Five Tastes." You see, Jake ate a sweet plum. Marceline played some savory licks. Tree Trunks had a sour taste inside her mouth. Oh, my. Gunther wanted to drink the salty tears. And Football's tea was bitter.  Huh? What? What's that you say? You thought the theme was the "Five Fingers"?  Don't be silly. Nobody's had five fingers for  Five telepathy glands, maybe.  Slimmin'. Well, anyway, looks like it's that time again. I'll see you crimpy glimmers on the triode flimpin' the diode.
